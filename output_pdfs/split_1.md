The MSC-Training link above will point you to schedule and description of MSC Seminars. Following courses are recommended for beginning Nastran users.  

# NAS101A - Linear Static and Normal Modes Analysis using MSC Nastran  

This course serves as an introduction to finite element analysis. It includes discussion of basic features available in MSC Nastran for solving structural engineering problems. In this course, allfinite element models willbe created and edited using a text editor, not a graphical pre-processor. Proper data structure of the MSC Nastran input file is covered.At the conclusion of seminar, the student willbe familiar with fundamental usage of MSC Nastran.  

# NAS101B - Advanced Linear Analysis using MSC Nastran  

This course is a continuation of NAS101A - Linear Static and Normal Modes Analysis using MSC Nastran. In this course, you will learn:  

Theory of buckling analysis and how to perform a buckling analysis, $\blacktriangledown$ About rigid elements - MPC, RBAR, RBE2 and RBE3, $\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\left(\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\right)$ Modeling with interface element, CINTC and connectors, $\mathbf{\delta} $ Lamination theory and composite materials, MSC Nastran composite theory, Failure theories, Linear contact and permanent glued contact $\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\equiv\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}$ Different model checks Modeling tips and tricks.  

# NAS120 - Linear Static Analysis using MSC Nastran and Patran  

Thi seminar introduces basic finite element analysis techniques forlinearstatic, normal modes, and buckling analysis of structures using MSC Nastran and Patran.MSC Nastran data structure, the element library, modeling practices, model validation, and guidelines for effcient solutions are discussed and illustrated with examples and workshops. Patran will be an integral part of the examples and workshops and willbe used to generate and verify ilustrative MSC Nastran models, manage analysis submision requests, and visualize results.This seminar provides the foundation required for intermediate and advanced MSC Nastran applications.  

# Executing MSC Nastran  

Executing MSC Nastran  

# Executing MsC Nastran  

MSC Nastran is executed from the command line using the command nast20200. This command sets environment variables in order for MSC Nastran to correctly execute on your system and it also has capabilities to predict memory and solvers (as of MSC Nastran 2020 with solve $\mathrel{\mathop:}=$ auto). The basic format of the nast20200 command is  

nast20200 input_data_file keywords nast20200 input_data_file [keywordl $\c=$ valuel keyword2 $\c=$ value2 ...] where input_data_file is the name of the file containing the input data and keyword $\c=$ valuei is one or more optinal keyword assignment arguments. For example, to run an MSC Nastran job using the data file examplel.dat, enter the following command:  

nast20200 examplel  

Most keyword asignments can be specified as command line arguments and/or included in RC files.There are some exceptions which may be specified on the command line or the User RC files,but not in the system RC files (MSC_BASE/conf/RCfile).  

There are two RC files controlled by the user:  

The user RC file is in your home (or login) directory. This file should be used to define parameters that are applied to all jobs run by the user. The local RC file is nast20200rc on Linux and NAST20200.rcf on Windows, and is located in the same directory as the input data file. If the“rcf" keyword is used, this local RC file is ignored. This file should be used to define parameters that are applied to all jobs contained in the input data file directory.   
1. The tilde (-) character is not recognized within RC files.   
2.Environment variables are only recognized when used in the context ofalogical symbol (on Windows NAST20200.rcf) (see Using Filenames and Logical Symbols in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide).   
3.When a keyword is specified on the command line, embedded spaces or special characters that are significant to the shell must be properly quoted; quotes should not be used within RC files.  

The keywords listed as follows are the most common for various computers, but are not available on all computers.Also,the defaults may be site-dependent. Please consult your Keywords and Environment Variables in the MSC Nastran Instalation and Operations Guide for keyword applicability, specialized keywords, and further discussion of the keywords and their defaults.Keywords that use yes/no values accept partial specification and case-independent values.For example,“yes" may be specified as“y",“ye",or“yes"using uppercase or lowercase letters. The examples assume the jobs are run under a Linux operating system.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>after (Linux)</td><td>after = time Default: None</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4"></td><td>Holds the job's execution until the time specified by time. See the description of the“at" command in your system documentation for the format of time</td></tr><tr><td>Example: nast20200 example after=10:00</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">The job is held until 10:00 AM.</td></tr></table></body></html>

If"yes" is specified, the job is run as a background process. If “no” is specified, the job is run in the foreground. If the“aft" or“queue” keywords are specified, the batch keyword is ignored.

dmp $\v{r}=$ dmparallel Default: No parallelism based upon dividing the model The dmp keyword specifies the number of processors used to efficiently obtain a solution to the simulation. These processors may be on the same node or on multiple nodes specified by the HOST command line option.  

Specifying dmparallel $>1$ and not including a DOMAINSOLVER Executive Command Statement has the following effects.  

The extraction of real eigenvalues using the default Lanczos method will be performed in parallel in SOL 103 and 111. $\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\equiv\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}$ The frequency response using SOL 1ll will be performed in parallel.  

Specifying dmp $>1$ and using the DOMAINSOLVER provides the following addition user controlled performance gains using parallel processing  

The extraction of eigenvalues may be performed using Automated Component Modal Synthesis (ACMS) which is an approximate method that is very computational efficient when a large number of modes (high frequencies) are required.   
Design sensitivity may be performed in parallel in SOL 200   
The formation of using advanced nonlinear elements stiffness matrices may be performed in parallel for SOL 400.  

It may also be necessary to define a host file if a network based distributed computing is used. See the MSC Nastran Installation and Operators Guide.  

gpuid  

gpuid $\vDash$ id,id or gpuid $\c=$ id:id Default: none id: the ID of a licensed GPU device to be used in the analysis.  

In MSC Nastran 2019 Feature Pack 1 release, the GPUs are used for two types of operations: matrix factorization and matrix multiplication. In the routines that use GPUs for matrix factorization, only one GPU will be used per DMP process. So in order to use multiple GPUs, the user must also use multiple DMP processes:  

prod_ver job gpuid $\scriptstyle=0$ ,1,...,ngpu-1 dmp $\L_{\L}=$ ndmp, where ndmp≥ngpu.  

Each DMP process will be assigned a GPU ID in round robin fashion.  

In MPYAD and FASTFR modules, on the other hand, multiple GPUs can be used for matrix multiplication by a single process, as long as the number of SMPthreads is equal to or larger than the number of GPUs. These modules also use multiple parallel streams for data transfer between the GPU and the host system, so it is recommended to use the maximum number of available CPU cores/threads because that helps reduce the overhead of data transfer between the host and the GPUs.  

So, for example, in order to achieve the best performance on a system with 20 CPU cores and 2 GPUs the user is advised to run Nastran with:  

prod_ver job dmp $^{.=2}$ smp $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\alpha=10}$ gpuid $_{.=0}$ ,1 prod_ver job dmp $\scriptstyle\cdot=4$ smp $_{\cdot=5}$ gpuid $_{.=0}$ ,1.  

Only up to 8 CUDA-compatible GPUs can be supported.  

gpu_min_rank  

gpu_min_rank=value Default: 32  

The criteria for GPGPU execution during matrix factorization are the frontal matrix front size and the rank of the frontal matrix. Minimum dimensions are set via gpu_min_front and its companion parameter, gpu_min_rank. The value specified must be an integer greater or equal to 1. If the rank of the frontal matrix is smaller than value, the rank update of the front is processed on the CPU. Otherwise, the GPGPU device would be used for the rank update of the front. This keyword may also be set via SYSTEM cell 655.

If“out" is not specified, the output files are saved in the current directory using the basename of the input data file as a prefix. If the“out" value is a directory, output files are created in the specified directory using the basename of the input data file as the filename.  

In the following examples, assume the current directory includes subdirectories“mydir" and “other”, and that an“example.dat" exists in both the current directory and“other". That is, ./example.dat, ./mydir, ./other, and ./other/example.dat exist on Linux; and .lexample.dat, .lmydir, .lother, and .lotherlexample.dat exist on Windows.

Specifies the maximum number of processors selected for shared-memory parallel (SMP) processing in several numeric modules. In some cases SMP parallelization can be combined with DMP. In such cases, the smp keyword specifies the number of threads per process used in the simulation.  

smp parallelization is available for mathematical kernels.  

smp parallelization is available for the Intel MKL PARDISO solver in SOL 101, 107, 108,111, 200, and 400; see the SPARSESOLVER section of this document.  

smp parallelization is available for the NLEMG modules and is disabled in the following cases:

For example, if smp=8 is desired but an SFM results, then rerun with sysl07=65544 in replace of smp=8. This turns off the SMP parallelization for NLEMG. solve={auto|train} Default (not set) If solve=auto then Nastran will automatically select the solver/parallel/memory.</td></tr><tr><td>symbol</td><td>If solve=train then Pardiso memory coefficients will be updated. These options may be placed on the command line or in the User's RC files. symbol=name=string Default: None Defines a symbolic (or logical) name used in ASSIGN and INCLUDE statements and in command line arguments. This keyword may be specified in initialization or RC files and on the command line. The symbol definition may include references to previously defined symbols or environment variables using the standard "$name" or "${name)" syntax on Linux or %name% syntax on Windows. For convenience, the character separating the "symbol" and "name" specification and the"name" and "string" specification may be either an equal sign ("='") or a hash mark ("#"). The use of a hash mark allows this keyword to be specified as an argument to a Windows .bat file. If "node" is specified, symbolic names defined using this keyword are not used on the local system. Instead the specified values are passed to the remote system. This means that any pathnames must be valid on the remote system. Use the "lsymbol" keyword to</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Symbolic names are processed in the order they are encountered while processing the initialization and RC files and the command line. If a duplicate symbolic name is encountered, the new value replaces the previously specified value.  

Symbolic names must be 16 characters or less. The value assigned to the symbolic name must be 256 characters orless. If the symbolic name used in an ASSIGN or INCLUDE statement or in command line arguments is not defined, it is left in the filename specification as is.  

For example, many of the .tpl and .demo input data files have ASSIGN statements such as the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>(Linux) symbol=DBSDIR=/dbs (Windows) symbol=DBSDIR=d:\dbs When the previous ASSIGN statement is processed, the filename assigned to the logical name MASTER is /dbs/abc.master on Linux and d:\dbs\abc.master on Windows. An alternate way of defining symbolic names is through the use of environment variables. For example, typing the following command export DBSDIR=/dbs at a Korn shell prompt, or setenv DBSDIR /dbs</td><td>ASSIGN 'MASTER=DBSDIR:abc.master' The string "DBSDIR:" specifies a symbolic name that is to be replaced by another string. The replaced string is defined by the "symbol=" keyword (or "lsymbol=" keyword if "node" was not specified) in an initialization or RC file, on the command line, or as environment variable. For example,</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Note: Ifa symbolic name is defined by both a symbol statement in an RC file and by an environment variable, the symbol statement value will be used.  

The section titled Environment Variables in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide contains a list of environment variables that are automatically created by the nastran command. Of particular interest to the logical symbol feature are the OUTDIR and DBSDIR variables. These variables refer to the directory that will contain the output files (set using the “out" keyword) and the directory that will contain the permanent database files (set using the “dbs" keyword), respectively.

The NASTRAN Statement  

# TheNASTRAN Statement  

The NASTRAN statement is used to specify values for certain Executive System operational parameters. These parameters are also called system cells.The NASTRAN statement is used for exceptional circumstances and is therefore not needed in most runs. The NASTRAN statement may also be specified in the runtime configuration (RC)files at the system,user,and joblevel asdescribed in the MSc Nastran 2020 Instalation and Operations Guide.  

Specifies values for certain Executive System operational parameters called system cells.  

Format: NASTRAN cellnamei $\mathsf{i}=\mathsf{e}$ xpressioni,...,cellname $\scriptstyle n=\e$ xpressionn  

or  

NASTRAN SYSTEM(i) $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ expressioni, ..., SYSTEM(n) $\c=$ expressionn

# Remarks:  

1. The NASTRAN statements may appear anywhere in the File Management Section. The NASTRAN statement may also be specified in runtime configuration (RC) files. See Customizing Command Initialization and Runtime Configuration Files (App.A) in the.   
2. System cellvalues and their associated cellnames may also be set with the DEFINE statement. They may also be set or values returned with the DMAP PUTSYS and GETSYS functions and the PARAM module. See PUTSYS, GETSYS in the DMAP Programmer's Guide.   
3. More than one NASTRAN statement and/or DEFINE statement may be present and, ifa system cell is specified more than once among these statements,then the last specification takes precedence.   
4.The expression willuse type conversion rules based on the type (i.e.,integer, real, or logical) of the cellname, as defined on a previous DEFINE statement (see the DEFINE statement for conversion rules).   
5.If expression is omitted, the system cell associated with the cellname will be assigned the value as se on a previous DEFINE statement.  

# Examples:  

1. Either of the following statements could be used to change the default value for block size. NASTRAN SYSTEM $\begin{array}{r l r}{(1)}&{{}=}&{4097}\end{array}$ or NASTRAN BUFFSIZE = 4097 or, if a prior DEFINE statement had defined a keyword MY_SYSBUF to the value 4097, then the following code could be used: $(\mathrm{1)=MY}$ R  

NASTRAN BUFFSIZE $\c=$ MYSYSBUF

#  

1. RESTART VERSION $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}$ . Version number 7 willbe retrieved for this run (version 8）. At the end of the run version 7 will be deleted.   
2. PROJ $\mathbf{\partial}=\mathbf{\vec{\mathbf{\tau}}}$ FENDER" RESTART The last version under project-ID FENDER will be used in the current run.  

# The File Management Section (FMS)  

The File Management Section (FMS) is primarily intended for the atachment and initialization of Database sets (DBsets)and FORTRAN files.The initialization of DBsets includes specification of their maximum size, member names, and physical filenames.The initialization of FORTRAN files includes the specification of their filenames, FORTRAN unit numbers, and FORTRAN attributes.  

In most classes of problems that use MSC Nastran solution sequences (SOLs), no File Management statements are required because a default File Management Section is executed atthe beginning of every run. The default File Management Section is described in the Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide. If a restart is desired, then the RESTART statement is required.All other solutions may not be restarted. If the problem is large in terms of requiring significant amounts of memory or disk space, then the INIT, ASSIGN, and EXPAND statements may be required. If any FORTRAN files are required, then the ASSIGN statement is required; for example,the OUTPUT2 DMAP module.The ASSIGN statement is also required to assign databases for DBLOCATE, DBLOAD, and DBUNLOAD.Special database operations are performed by the DBLOCATE, DBLOAD, DBUNLOAD, DBLCLEAN, ACQUIRE, DBDICT, DBFIX, DBSETDEL, DBUPDATE, and PROJECT statements.  

# File Management Statement Summary  

The following is a summary of all File Management statements:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>$</td><td>Comment statement.</td></tr><tr><td>ACQUIRE</td><td>Selects NDDL schema and MSC Nastran delivery database.</td></tr><tr><td>ASSIGN</td><td>Assigns physical files to DBset members or special FORTRAN files.</td></tr><tr><td>CONNECT</td><td>Group geometry data by evaluator and database.</td></tr><tr><td>DBCLEAN</td><td>Deletes selected database version(s) and/or projects.</td></tr><tr><td>DBDICT</td><td>Prints the database directory in user-defined format.</td></tr><tr><td>DBFIX</td><td>Identifies and optionally corrects errors found in the database.</td></tr><tr><td>DBLOAD</td><td>Loads a database previously unloaded by DBUNLOAD.</td></tr><tr><td>DBLOCATE</td><td>Obtains data blocks and parameters from databases.</td></tr><tr><td>DBSETDEL</td><td>Deletes DBsets.</td></tr><tr><td>DBUNLOAD</td><td>Unloads a database for compression, transfer, or archival storage.</td></tr><tr><td>DBUPDATE</td><td>Specifies the time between updates of the database directory.</td></tr><tr><td>ENDJOB</td><td>Terminates a job upon completion of FMS statements.</td></tr><tr><td>EXPAND</td><td>Concatenates additional DBset members to an existing DBset.</td></tr><tr><td>INCLUDE</td><td>Inserts an external file in the input file.</td></tr><tr><td>INIT</td><td>Creates a temporary or permanent DBset.</td></tr><tr><td>NASTRAN</td><td>Specifies values for system cells.</td></tr><tr><td>PROJ</td><td>Defines the current or default project identifier.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The FMS statements are executed in the following order regardless of their order ofappearance in the input file:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>NASTRAN,DEFINE</td></tr><tr><td>RFINCLUDE,INCLUDE</td></tr><tr><td>ASSIGN,INIT,EXPAND,DBUPDATE</td></tr><tr><td>PROJECT</td></tr><tr><td>DBCLEAN</td></tr><tr><td>DBFIX</td></tr><tr><td>DBDICT(1)</td></tr><tr><td>DBSETDEL</td></tr><tr><td>ACQUIRE</td></tr><tr><td>RESTART</td></tr><tr><td>DBLOCATE DBUNLOAD</td></tr><tr><td>DBLOAD</td></tr><tr><td>DBDIR (2),DBDICT(2)</td></tr><tr><td>ENDJOB</td></tr></table></body></html>  

If DBDICT is specified before any of the FMS statements DBSETDEL through DBLOAD, then the directory printout willreflect the processing of DBCLEAN and DBFIX only. If DBDICT is specified after DBSETDEL through DBLOAD, then the directory printout will reflect the processing of allstatements in the FMS Section. We recommend that the DBDICT statements be specified last in the FMS Section. Multiple DBLOCATE, DBLOAD, or DBUNLOAD statements are processed in the order in which they appear. If the ENDJOB statement is specified, then only the File Management Section is procesed and the Executive Control, Case Control, and Bulk Data Sections are ignored.  

# File Management Statement Descriptions  

File Management statements may be abbreviated down to the firstfour characters as long as the abbreviation is unique relative to all other statements. Each statement is described as follows:  

Description  

A brief sentence about the function of the statement is given.  

Format  

Describers in uppercase are keywords that must be specified as shown. In addition, describers in lowercase indicate that the user must provide a value.  

Braces $\{\}$ indicate that a choice of describers is mandatory. If the describers are stacked vertically, then only one may be specified.  

Brackts[] indicate thatachoice of describers is optional.Ifthe describers are stacked verticaly, then only one may be specified.  

Describers that are shaded indicate the defaults.  

If the statement line is longer than 72 columns, then it may be continued to the next line with a comma a: long as the comma is preceded by one or more spaces and no keyword is split acros lines.For example:  

DBLOCATE DATABLK $\varXi$ (KAA) WHERE（PROJECT $\mathbf{\omega}=\mathbf{\vec{\Gamma}}$ FRONT BUMPER' AND SEID>O AND VERSION $=4$ ） LOGI $\c=$ MASTER3  

However, if a filename is to be continued on the next line, no space must precede the comma, and the continuation line must have no leading spaces.  

# Example  

ASSIGN $\mathsf{S D B}\mathrm{=}^{\prime}/\dot{\mathsf{J}}\mathsf{w}/\dot{\mathsf{J}}$ ohannes/Projects/secret/Aero/Tests/wing/, Modes/wing modal.MASTER'  

Note that all quote marks shown under formats and examples are right-handed single quotation marks and must be entered as such. For example:  

PROJ $\prime=\prime$ MYJOB'  

Example  

A typical example is given.  

Describers and Meaning  

Each of the describers is briefly discussed.The describer's type (e.g.,Integer, Real, or Character),allowable range,anddefault value are enclosed in parentheses.The describer must be specified by the user if no default value is given.  

# Remarks  

The remarks are generally arranged in order of importance and indicate such things as the FMS statement's relationship to other commands, restrictions and recommendations on its use, and further descriptions of the describers.  

# WHERE and CONVERT Clauses  

The WHERE clause is used in the selection of items (data blocks and parameters) on the DBDICT, DBLOCATE, DBLOAD, and DBUNLOAD statements.The CONVERT clause modifies qualifier values of items selected by the WHERE clause on the DBLOCATE and DBLOAD statements.  

The WHERE and CONVERT clauses specify values for PROJECT, VERSION, qualifiers, and DBSET. PROJECT specifies the project-ID that is originally defined on the PROJECT FMS statement at the time the project is created. VERSION specifies the desired version-ID under the project-ID.Qualifiers are used to uniquely identify items on the database with the same name.For example, data block KAA has SEID as one of its qualifiers, which is the superelement ID. An item may have more than one qualifier and the collection of allqualifiers assgned to an item is called a path.All data blocks and parameters with qualifiers are defined in the NDDL Sequence (NASTRAN Data Definition Language), see MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide. Data blocks and parameters are defined on the DATABLK and PARAM NDDL statements.The DATABLK and PARAM statements specify the name of the data block, parameter, and also its pathname.The pathnames are defined on the PATH NDDL statement, which lists the qualifiers assigned to the path. Qualifiers are defined on the QUAL NDDL statement. DBSET specifies the desired DBset. The DBset of an item is specified after the LOCATION keyword on the DATABLK and PARAM NDDL statement.  

The format of the WHERE clause is:  

WHERE (where-expr)  

where-expr is a logical expression that specifies the desired values of qualifiers, PROJECT, VERSION,and DBSET If the result of thelogical expression is TRUE for an item on the database then the item is selected. For example, WHERE(VERSION $\stackrel{\cdot}{=}4$ AND SEID $<>2$ AND SEID ${>}0$ ) selects all items under version 4 for all values of SEID greater than O except 2.  

A simple where-expr is a comparison using the following relational operators: $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ ,>,<,<,, $><$ or $\mathrm{<}>$ . For example, $\mathrm{SElD}{>}0$ means if SEID is greater than zero, then the logical expression is true.Several simple where expressions may be joined into one where expression by the follwing logical operators: AND, OR, XOR, and EQV. The NOT operator may be used to negate a where expression. For example, $\mathrm{NOT}(\mathrm{SEID}{>}0)$ is the same as $\mathrm{SEID}{\scriptstyle\leq0}.$ Arithmetic operations and DMAP functions may also be specified in the where expression (see the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide.)  

If a qualifier in a where-expr is not a qualifier in the path of a specified item, then the where-expr is set to FALSE.If the where-expr does not contain a specification for all qualifiers in the path of an item,then the unspecified qualifiers will be wildcarded (i.e., quali $\boldsymbol{\cdot}=^{*}$ , all values willbe selected.) The default values of qualifiers, PROJECT, VERSION,and DBSET are described under the statement in which the WHERE clause is specified.  

Examples of the WHERE clause are:  

1. Select allitems in the database for all superelements except 10 and 30 from Version 1. WHERE（VERSION ${\bf\bar{\rho}}=1$ AND SEI $D{\>}=0$ AND NOT(SEID=1O OR $\mathtt{S E I D=}30$ )) 2. Select all entries in database on DBSET $\dot{\bf{\theta}}={\bf{\theta}}$ DBALL from all projects and versions.  

WHERE（PROJECT $\c=$ PROJECT AND VERSlON>O AND DBSET $\cdot=\prime$ DBALL')  

The CONVERT clause modifies project- and version-ID, DBset-name (see INIT statement),and qualifier values of items selected by the WHERE clause on the DBLOCATE and DBLOAD statements. It contains one or more assignment statements separated by semicolons. The format of CONVERT clause is:  

The PROJECT and VERSION statements modify the project-ID (see PROJECT FMS statement) and version-ID.The DBSET statement modifies the DBset-name. The value of quali willbe replaced by qual-expri for selected items that have quali in their path.qual-expri is any valid expression (se Expressions and Operators in the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide) containing constants or any qualifier name defined in the path ofthe item.If qual-expri contains names of qualifiers not in the path ofthe selected item, then a fatal message is issued.If project-expr and/or version-expr produces a project-or version-ID which does not exist, thenone willbe created.Also, all version-IDs less than version-expr thatdo not exist will be created; but they will be“empty."  

Examples of the CONVERT clause are:  

1. Set qualifiers SEID, PEID, and SPC to constants 10, 20, 102 respectively CONVERT $\mathrm{:SEID=1}0;\mathrm{PEID=}20;\mathrm{SPC=}102)$ If more than one value ofa qualifier is found for an item by the WHERE clause, then each value is processed in qual-expri to define the new qualifier value for each of the selected items. In the following example,ifthe original values of PEID were 1,2,and 3; then the new values for the SElD qualifier will be 2, 4, and 6.   
2. Set all values of qualifier SElD to be twice the value of the PEID qualifier: CONVERT(SElD=2\*PElD)

Remarks:  

1. The ASSIGN statement and its applications are discussed further in the Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
2.The log-name or logical-key describer must be the first describer on the ASSIGN statement.All other describers may appear in any order. With the exception of log-name, logical-key, filenamel, filename2, and sys-spec, describers and values longer than four characters may be abbreviated to four characters.   
3. For FORTRAN files, the logical-key names and their default attributes are listed in Table 3-1. If a logical-key name is identified as“Assignable YES", then the defaults may be overridden on the ASSIGN statement.   
4. Certain reserved names may not be used for log-names or logical-key names. These names are the logical names listed in Table 3-1 that are identified as“Assignable NO". This list includes: SEMTRN, LNKSWH, MESHFL, LOGFL, INPUT, PRINT, INCLD1, and CNTFL. If they are used, then a User Fatal Message is issued. Unit numbers 1 through 10, 14, 16, 18, 19 and 21 should not be assigned. Up to 4000 ASSIGNs are allowed. Some operating systems may have a smaller limit. To avoid that limit use“ulmit -n $4096"$ . Unit numbers 1234, 1235, 1236, 1133 to 2269 are not allowed. Some operating systems may have their own limit on the number of open files as well. PUNCH and PLOT may be used, but are not recommended. Most keyword assgnments can be specified as command line arguments and/or included in RC files. There are some exceptions such as solve $\mathrel{\mathop:}=$ auto may be specified on the command line or the User RC files, but not in the system RC files (MSC_BASE/conf/RCfile).   
5.If one of the logical-key names indicated in the Remarks 3.and 4.is not specified on this statement, then it is assumed to be a DBset member name log-name as shown in Format l.  

6. If the same log-name is used on more than one DBset ASSIGN statement, the folowing rules apply  

a.If there is no current entry for the specified log-name, a new entry in the DBset tables will be created. If there is an existing entry for the specified log-name, the ASSIGN parameters will modify that entry instead of creating a new one.   
b. If filenamel is omitted or is specified as \* or\*\*, the default file name or, if this is a second or subsequent ASSIGN statement for the same log-name, the previously specified file name (or default name if none was previously specified) will be used.  

7. If the same logical-key is used on more than one FORTRAN file ASSIGN statement, the following rules apply:  

a.Iffilename2 is omitted (or specified as \*or\*\*) and if the UNIT describer is omitted, the ASSIGN parameters will modify the system default entry for the logical-key, establishing the new defaults for any subsequent ASSIGN entry for the logical-key. Note, however, that any entries previously created with the same logical-key will not be modified by the new parameters specified on this ASSIGN statement.   
b. If the value specified by the UNIT describer matches the value for an entry created by a previous ASSIGN statement with a UNIT describer, then: If the logical-key values are different, a UFM will be generated; and   
·If the logical-key values are the same, the previous entry willbe updated instead of having a new entry created.   
c. If the value specified by the UNIT describer does not match the value for an entry created by a previous ASSIGN statement with a UNIT describer, then a new entry will be created in the FORTRAN unit tables.   
d.If the file name is omitted or specified as \* or\*\*, the default file name or, if this is a second or subsequent ASSIGN statement for the same logical-key/UNIT combination, a previously specified file name (or default name if none was previously specified) will be used.  

8.If you are using IFPSTAR (default), you can use below command to import IFPDAT file created by the initial run if the file is not located in the same directory as MASTER and DBALL files. ASSIGN IFPDB $\v{D}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ first_run_directory/runl.IFPDAT IMPORT.  

9. STATUS, UNIT, and FORM are ignored if assigning a log-name (DBset member name).  

10.FORM $\mathop{\left.\sum}\right.$ FORMATTED must be specified for a unit when:  

ASCII output is desired from the OUTPUT4 DMAP modules that processes the unit. See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide.   
FORMAT $\dot{\bf\Phi}={\bf\Phi}$ NEUTRAL is selected on the DBUNLOAD and DBLOAD FMS statements tha process the unit. See the Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide. The neutral file format is desired for the OUTPUT2 module.   
·PostScript output is desired for PLOT requests when“PLOTTER NAST" is in effect.  

11. For the DBUNLOAD FMS statement and the OUTPUT2 and OUTPUT4 modules, binary format may be requested using FORM $\mathop{\left.\sum}\right.$ UNFORMATTED, FORM $\c=$ UNFORMATTED_64, FORM $\dot{}=}$ UNFORMATTED_32 and FORM $\dot{.}=\dot{}$ UNFORMATTED_MIX. The output formats with these keywords are as the following:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>FORM</td><td>Table (bit)</td><td>Matrix (bit)</td><td> Old keyword</td></tr><tr><td>UNFORMATTED</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>UNFORMATTED</td></tr><tr><td>UNFORMATTED_64</td><td>64</td><td>64</td><td>LITTLEENDIAN64</td></tr><tr><td>UNFORMATTED_32</td><td>32</td><td>32</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>UNFORMATTED_MIX</td><td>32</td><td>64</td><td>LITTLEENDIAN</td></tr></table></body></html>  

12．The FORM $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ describer is ignored for the DBLOAD FMS statement and INPUTT2 and INPUTT4 modules.MSC Nastran determines the actual file format when it accesses the specified file. If the FORM $\dot{.}=\dot{}$ describer is specified on an ASSIGN statement for these logical-keys, the syntax of the describer will be validated but will otherwise be ignored. However,  

For non-native binary files the INPUTT2 modules can only process data blocks with an NDDL description. (See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide under the DATABLK statement.) An NDDL description is required for TYPE $\c=^{\prime}$ TABLE and none is required for TYPE $\v{x}_{1}=$ MATRIX.The data block must be processed with FORM $\mathop{\left.\sum}\right.$ UNFORMATTED if TYPE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ UNSTRUCTURED, KDICT, or KELM. Although formatted files are machine independent, if the file in unformatted DBLOAD can only process input files in native binary format.  

13. For the DBUNLOAD FMS statement and OUTPUT2 module, if FORM is other than UNFORMATTED (or equivalent, e.g., UNFORMATTED_32 on a Linux or Windows platform), then only data blocks with an NDDL description are processed. (See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide under the DATABLK statement.) An NDDL description is required for TYPE $\c=$ TABLE and none is required for TYPE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ MATRIX. The data block must be processed with FORM $\dot{}=}$ UNFORMATTED if TYPE $\v{x}_{1}=$ UNSTRUCTURED, KDICT, or KELM.   
14.See the MSCNastran 2020 Instalationand Operations Guide for further information on sys-spec controls and on machine-dependent aspects of the ASSIGN statement. Also, if there are SYS specifications on more than one ASSIGN statement specifying the same log-name or logical-key/UNIT combination, the second and subsequent specifications will appended to the current SYS specification with a comma separator.   
15.Currently the RECL keyword is used by the DBC module and has a default minimum of 1024 words. The maximum allowed is 65536 words and is used to increase the database capacity.   
16. The SIZE keyword is used by the DBC module and has a default of 16777215. The maximum allowed is 2147483647 and is used to increase the database capacity. Patran releases before 2001 should use the defaults for RECL and SIZE or database verification failures will occur.  

17. logical-key name MNF does not utilize UNIT or FORM.  

18.For logical-key DBC, ifthe .xdb file is new, the desired binary format may be specified in the same way as for the OUTPUT2 and OUTPUT4 modules, as described in Remark 11., except that FORM $\mathbf{\Psi}_{:}=\mathbf{\Psi}_{:}$ FORMATTED is not valid. If the .xdb file is not new, the FORM $\c=$ describer is ignored and MSC Nastran determines the format of the existing .xdb file. MSC Nastran can read and or update an .xdb file in any valid format. Note, on long-word systems (mode $_{:=\mathrm{i}8}$ ） the effect of 64-bit output files is that ADAMS(MNF), Patran, and SimXpert may fail to process the results.  

19. SOL700 reserves unit numbers 87-92 for its internal use.When using SOL700 users should not use these unit number to avoid conflicts.  

20.The total length of any line in an ASSIGN statement must not exceed 72 characters. Long file names may be split across multiple lines with commas at the end of line and next to be without spaces. For example,the file: ASSIGN SCR300='E:\hrishikesh_scr300\testing\delimiter\isse\scratch.SCR300' DELETE should be specified with the following input: ASSIGN SCR300='E:\hrishikesh_scr300\testing), delimiter\issue\scratch.SCR300'DELETE.

Defines the newly introduced Simulation Component Architecture (SCA) User Defined Service (UDS) into MSC Nastran via a new CONNECT SERVICE statement. Bulk Data entries such as NLRSFD and MATUDS refer to this new service.  

External geometric or beam crossection entities, external design responses, and external splines are still defined through the old grouping also described below. These entities should belong to the same evaluator-class(set ofroutines that processthem),and in the case ofgeometric data, shouldresideon the same database.  

1.A group of external geometric entities.These entities should belong to the same evaluator-class(a set of routines that process them), and should reside on the same database. The GMCURV and GMSURF Bulk Data entries relate to the GEOMEVAL type.   
2. A group of external beam cross section entities. These entities should belong to the same evaluatorclass (a set of routines that process them). The PBARL and PBEAML entries relate to the BEAMEVAL type.   
3. A group of external spline entities. The SPLINEX Bulk Data entry relates to the SPLINEX type.   
4. A group of external design response entities. The DRESP3 Bulk Data entry relates to the DRESP3 type.  

UDS Format: CONNECT SERVICE <service_identifier> <service_name>  

Old Group Format: GEOMEVAL   
CONNECT BEAMEVAL group evaluator'path''data' DRESP3 SPLINEX  

# UDS Examples:  

CONNECT SERVICE mysub 'SCA.MDSolver.Util.Ums' Creates a service identifier“mysub" which points to the“SCA.MDSolver.Util.Ums" service.  

CONNECT SERVICE MYSUB 'ExtSerV.Nlrsfd'  

In this case, the user is requesting the NLRSFD Bulk Data entry with the GRPNAME MYSUB obtain its characteristics from the externally connected service defined in the CDL file under the component keyword. The user must create an external shared object library (dynamic link library on Windows) using the SCA Scons utility and configure it to function with the MSC Nastran executable.  

Old Group Examples:  

CONNECT GEOMEVAL FENDER，CATIA,′/u/kiz/adp'，'Version $=6$ as of1/31/93′  

In this case, the user is requesting that allcalculations on GMCURV and GMSURF Bulk Data entries that are grouped as FENDER use the CATIA database/evaluator. For each GMCURV and GMSURF entry where the group parameter is set to FENDER, appropriate evaluator routines will be called to initialize and perform computations on the curve or surface.  

CONNECT GEOMEVAL HOOD， MSCRPC  

In this case, the user is requesting that allcalculations on GMCURV and GMSURF Bulk Data entries that are grouped as HOOD use the Nastran RPC database/evaluator. There is no need for additional routines to be supplied by the user since the MSCRPC and MSCEQN evaluator libraries are included in the standard Nastran delivery.  

CONNECT GEOMEVAL DOOR， MSCEQN  

In this case, the user is requesting that allcalculations on GMCURV and GMSURF Bulk Data entries that are grouped as DOOR use the Nastran EQUATION database/evaluator. There is no need for additional routines to be supplied by the user since the MSCRPC and MSCEQN evaluator libraries are included in the Nastran standard delivery.  

CONNECT BEAMEVAL HOIST， NEWBEAMS  

In this case, the user is requesting that all calculations on PBARL and PBEAML Bulk Data entries that are grouped as HOIST use the NEWBEAMS evaluator. In this case, the user must supply the NEWBEAMS beam crossection evaluator library, and configure it to function with the Nastran executable program.  

CONNECT DRESP3 TAILWING， EXTRESP  

In this case, the user is requesting that allcalculations on DRESP3 Bulk Data entries,that are grouped as TAILWING use the EXTRESP evaluator. Thus,the user must create the EXTRESP external response server program, and configure it to function with the MSC Nastran executable.  

# CONNECT SPLINEX SPLNGRP EXTSPLN  

In this case, the user is requesting that all calculations on SPLINEX Bulk Data entries, that are grouped as SPLNGRP, use the EXTPLN evaluator. Thus, the user must create the EXTSPLN external spline server program and configure it to function with the Nastran executable.

Entities belonging to one evaluator-class are handled by the same set of routines (either MSC- provided or user-provided). For geometry, two classes of evaluators are provided internally with MSC Nastran. They are MSCRPC (rational parametric cubic) and MSCEQN (generic equation). For beam cross sections, the class MSCBML (MSC Beam Library) is provided internally. Users may develop custom evaluator libraries for geometry, beam cross sections, external responses, or external splines and configure them for use with MSC Nastran.

Remarks (UDS Format):  

1. The process of enabling User Defined Services in MSC Nastran consists of the folowing four steps:  

a. Creating the desired implementation for the User Defined Services in the form of dynamic-linl libraries,   
b. Defining the location of the user defined service, service catalogue, service resource directory.   
c. Specifying the proper commands in the model to load the service,   
d. Identifying the elements that use the user supplied implementation.  

2.In order to create a dynamic-link library suitable for usage with MSC Nastran,a build environment is delivered to assst the user in building the library. Please refer to the Simulation Component Architecture Guide and the User Defined Service Guide which describethefeatures and capabilities of the build system.  

Remarks (Old Group Format):  

1. CONNECT requests:  

$\cdot$ An external data base or evaluator, or A user-defined grouping for geometric data defined by GMCURV and GMSURF entries, or beam cross section data defined by PBARL and PBEAML entries.  

2.Two reserved group names, MSCGRPO and MSCGRP1,have been predefined for geometric entities. These names may be used in the GMCURV and GMSURF entries without being defined explicitly by means of a CONNECT FMS statement. The group MSCGRPO corresponds to the MSCRPC (rational parametric cubic) evaluator and the group MSCGRP1 corresponds to the MSCEQN (Generic Equation) evaluator.   
3. A single reserved group name, MSCBML0,has been predefined for beam crossection entities.It may be used in the PBARL and PBEAML entries without being defined explicitly by means of a CONNECT FMS statement. It corresponds to the MSCBML (MSC Beam-Library) evaluator.   
4. Custom geometric evaluator libraries developed by users should comply with the MSC Nastran Geometry Evaluator Developer's Guide.   
5. Custom beam cross section evaluator libraries developed by users should comply with the guidelines in the MSC Nastran V69 Release Guide, Section 3.1, Beam Cross-Section Library, and Appendix C: Adding Your Own Beam Cross-Section Library.   
6.Custom responses developed by users should comply with the procedures and guidelines in“Support of External Response in SOL $200^{\mathfrak{n}}$ on page 55 of the MSC Nastran 2004 Release Guide.   
7. Once developed, an evaluator may be configured as: Internal, where the evaluator routines are linked with the rest of the Nastran object modules tc comprise the Nastran executable program; or External, where the evaluator routines are linked with an MSC-provided server program to constitute an independent geometry server.

Remarks:  

1. There may be up to ten DBCLEAN statements in the FMS Section.   
2. If no project-ID is given, the current project-ID is assumed.  

# Example:  

DBCLEAN VERS $=~7$ PROJ $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ OUTER WING－ LEFT'  

The preceding example would delete from the database all data blocks and parameters stored under Versio1 7 of the project identified as OUTER WING - LEFT.  

DBDICT prints the following database directory tables:  

$\blacktriangledown$ Data blocks described by an NDDL DATABLK statement.   
$\left|\begin{array}{l l}{\mathbf{\overline{{u}}}}\end{array}\right.$ Parameters described by an NDDL PARAM statement.   
$\left|\begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{\sigma}}\\ {\mathbf{\overline{{u}}}}\end{array}\right.$ All unique paths (KEYs) and their qualifier values.

Basic Format:  

The basic format of DBDICT specifies which tables to print and prints all items (data blocks and parameters) found in the directory. Also, the atributes (colnames) to be printed, and the print format, are predefined. Note that more than one table may be specified on the same DBDICT statement.  

DBDICT [DATABLK PARAM PROJVERS QUALCURR QUALIFIERS]  

Examples:   
DBDICT   
DBDICT PARAM PROJVERS  

# Full Format:  

The full format permits the selection of items by name and/or by the WHEREdescriber.The fullformat also permits the attributes to be printed using the SELECT describer. In addition, the print format can be specified with the SORT, FORMAT, and LABEL describers. Note that the fullformat only allows the specification of a single table on a DBDICT statement.

CDATE is printed as YYMMDD where YY, MM, and DD are the year, month, and date, respectively. CTIME is HHMMSS where HH, MM, and SS are the hour, minute, and second, respectively.  

9.Ifa parameter or qualifier value is defined to be character string, then the value will be printed with enclosing single quotation marks. Blank strings willalso be printed with single quotation marks.   
10.If agiven qualifier is not in the path of a given data block or parameter, then blank spaces willbe printed.   
11.A line will wrap if additional columns need to be printed and not enough space is available on the output (assumed to be 132). The first column of each additional line is to be indented by the width of the first column printed for the entry.  

12. The where-expr has the following rules:  

·If the where-expr specifies a colname that is not assigned to the data block or parameter, then no directory information will be printed for that data block or parameter. For example, given that SPC is not a qualifier for KGG, the following DBDICT statement will produce no output: DBDICT DATABLK $\varXi$ KGG WHERE( $\mathrm{SPC=10}$ ）   
If the where-expr does not specify a colname that is assigned to the data block (or parameter), then the qualifier is wildcarded. For example, given that SEID is a qualifier for KAA, the following DBDICT statements are equivalent:  

DBDICT DATABLK $\varXi$ KAADBDICT DATABLK $\varXi$ KAA WHERE（SEID= \*  

13.A colname specified in the where-expr must be specified in the SELECT clause if the SELECT clause is also specified.  

# Examples:  

1. Print the project version table with a title. DBDICTPROJVERS SORT（PROJ,VERSION） LABEL（'PROJECT VERSION TABLE’ LEFT)   
2. Print a directory of all data blocks qualified with PEID $\scriptstyle\left.=10\right.$ or $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{EID}_{ Ḋ }=10 Ḍ$ . Print columns for the NAME and DBSET, and the qualifiers SPC, MPC, and LOAD.

Remarks:  

1. It is recommended that a backup copy of the database be made before this statement is used, since corrections of the database are achieved through the deletion of data. Data blocks and parameters are deleted from the database if they have (1) incorrect paths (different than listed in the NDDL); (2) incorrect names (two or more names that are not equivalenced and reference the same data), or (3) incorrect directory pointers.  

2. NOLIST does not suppress the listing of any corrections made to the database.

Remarks:  

1. The DBLOAD statement and its applications are discussed further in Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
2.If the DATABLK keyword is specified and PARAM is not specified, then only data blocks may be loaded. If the PARAM keyword is specified and DATABLK is not specified, then only parameters may be loaded. If neither DATABLK nor PARAM is specified, then all data blocks and parameters may be loaded.  

3. The DB keyword is equivalent to DATABLK, and the PARM keyword is equivalent to PARAM.   
4.The database to be loaded is attached as read-only.In other words, items can onlybe fetched and not stored on this database.   
5.If more than one DBLOAD statement is specified, then they will be procesed in the order in which they appear. If a duplicate data block or parameter is found on two or more different DBLOAD statements, then the last duplicate will be used.   
6. If NEUTRAL is specified, then the FORMATTED keyword must be specified on the corresponding ASSIGN statement.   
7. If a data block or parameter is being renamed, then the new name must be defined in the NDDL of the primary database.   
8.If the database to beloaded and the primary database have diffrent NDDL schemes and CONVERT is not used, then the following is performed: If a qualifier in the NDDL of the database to be loaded is not in the NDDL of the primary database, then all of its values are converted to the null value corresponding to its type. For example, if the qualifier is integer, real, double-precision, complex, or character, then the value is converted to 0, 0., 0.Do, (0.,0.), or blank, respectively. If this conversion results in a duplicate data block(s) or parameter(s), then a User Warning Message is printed and the duplicates are not loaded. If a DBset-name in the NDDL of the database to be loaded is not in the NDDL of the primary database, then its values will be converted to the PARAM default value in the NDDL of the database to be loaded.   
9.Data blocks that are equivalenced on the database to be loaded remain equivalenced as long as they are loaded in the same DBLOAD statement or in consecutive DBLOAD statements with the same  

unit number. Otherwise, a separate copy for the secondary data block is produced.  

10. It is not possible to restart from a database created by DBLOAD in the same run.  

11. SOL 190 (or DBTRANS) is also required with DBLOAD if:  

$\cdot$ The database to be loaded has a different BUFFSlZE.   
The database to be loaded is in neutral format or is being transferred between different machine types.

By default, the located database is also the primary database. (If dbname is specified for the</td></tr><tr><td>OVRWRT NOOVRWRT</td><td>primary database, then dbname must be MASTER.) By default, duplicate data blocks or parameters on the located database will take precedence over those on the primary database. A duplicate means that a data block or parameter has not only the same name but also the same qualifier values, PROJECT,</td></tr><tr><td>COPY</td><td>VERSION, and DBSET as the data block or parameter on the primary database. If NOOVRWRT is specified, then a fatal message is issued. Requests that the located data blocks or parameters be copied to the primary database.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Remarks:  

1. The DBLOCATE statement and its applications are discussed further in the Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
2. If the DATABLK keyword is specified and PARAM is not specified, then only data blocks may be located. If the PARAM keyword is specified and DATABLK is not specified, then only parameters may be located. If neither DATABLK nor PARAM is specified, then all data blocks and parameters may be located.   
3. The DB keyword is equivalent to DATABLK, and the PARM keyword is equivalent to PARAM.   
4.If more than one DBLOCATE statement is specified, then they willbe procesed in the order in which they appear. If a duplicate data block or parameter is found on two or more different DBLOCATE statements, then the last duplicate will be used.   
5.If thelocated database is not the primary database, then it is atached for read-only purposes. In other words, items can only be fetched and not stored on the located database.   
6.Ifthe RESTART FMS statement is also specified, then located data blocks and parameters are treated as if they exist in the restart version. In other words,restart equivalences willbe made on located items at the beginning of the run and can be subsequently broken as a result of regeneration and/or NDDL dependencies.   
7. Ifa data block or parameter is being renamed, then the new name must be defined in the NDDL of the primary database.   
8.If LOGICAL refers to the primary database and one version is to be copied to another, then the item: are equivalenced.   
9. If the located database and the primary database have different NDDL schemes and CONVERT is not used, then the following is performed: If a qualifier in the NDDL of the located database is not in the NDDL of the primary database, then all of its values are converted to the nullvalue corresponding to its type. For example, if the qualifier is integer, real, double precision, complex or character then the value is converted to 0,   
0.,0.Do, (O.,0.),or blank, respectively. If this conversion results in a duplicate data block(s) or parameter(s), then a User Warning Message is printed and the duplicates are not located. ·Ifa dbset-name in the NDDL of the located database is not in the NDDL of the primary database, then its values will be converted to the PARAM default value in the NDDL of the located database.

Remarks:  

1. The DBUNLOAD statement and its applications are discussed further in Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
2.If the DATABLK keyword is specified and PARAM is not specified, then only data blocks may be unloaded. If the PARAM keyword is specified and DATABLK is not specified, then only parameters may be unloaded. If neither DATABLK nor PARAM is specified, then all data blocks and parameters may be unloaded.   
3. The DB keyword is equivalent to DATABLK, and the PARM keyword is equivalent to PARAM.   
4.If more than one DBUNLOAD statement is specified, then they will be processed in the order in which they appear.   
5. IfNEUTRAL is specified, then the FORMATTED keyword must be specified on the corresponding ASSIGN statement.   
6.If NEUTRAL is specified, then only data blocks with an NDDL description are unloaded.(See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide under the DATABLK statement.) An NDDL description is required for TYPE $\cdot=^{'}$ TABLE and none is required for TYPE $\begin{array}{r}{{\bf\nabla}_{\bf\Pi}=}\end{array}$ MATRIX. The data block must be unloaded in BINARY if TYPE $\c=$ UNSTRUCTURED,KDICT, or KELM.   
7. Data blocks that are equivalenced on the primary database remain equivalenced as long as they are unloaded in the same DBUNLOAD statement or in consecutive DBUNLOAD statements with the same unit number. Otherwise, a separate copy for the secondary data block is produced.  

Specifies the maximum length of CPU time between database directory updates to the MASTER DBset. This statement is intended to be used if the INIT MASTER(RAM $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\bar{r}}$ ) option is specified.  

Format: DBUPDATE $[=]$ update-time  

# Example:  

DBUPDATE $\mathit{\Theta}=\ 5.5$  

The preceding example would callfor a database directory update at the end of a DMAP module executio: after five and one-half minutes of CPU time have elapsed from the last update.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>update-time</td><td>CPU time interval in minutes (real or integer) between database directory updates.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The diffrence in CPU time from the last update is checked after the execution of each DMAP instruction. The database directory is updated if this difference is greater than update-time. Update-time and CPU time is accurate to the nearest whole second only.   
2. If update-time $<0$ , then database directory updates are only performed at the end of the run.   
3. Defaults for update-time are machine dependent and may be found in the MSC Nastran Installation and Operations Guide.   
4. Periodic updates of the directory tables to MASTER DBset increases the integrity of the database during system crashes (for example, crashes due to insufficient time or space).   
5. Directory updates are performed automatically at various points in the execution of the DMAP in addition to those specified by DBUPDATE. An asterisk appears after the word “BEGN" in the executive summary table whenever an update occurs. See the Output Description in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide. These updates occur whenever a permanent data block, parameter DMAP equivalence, or restart equivalence is broken. Updates also occur upon deletions. Additions to the database do not automaticaly cause a directory update to take place.   
6. This statement is in effect only when INIT MASTER(RAM $\scriptstyle.={\mathrm{r}}$ ） is being used. INIT MASTER(S) and INIT MASTER(NORAM) disable periodic and automatic updates.   
7. Update-time may also be changed with the DMAP instruction PUTSYS(update-time, 128) or the NASTRAN SYSTEM(128) $\mid=$ update-time statement. (The update-time must be a real, single-precision value specified in minutes.)  

Assigns user-defined keywords (or cellnames) toa NASTRAN system cell.(See the NASTRAN statement for a description of“cellname".) In addition,the DEFINE statement provides a mechanism to set default values for system cells.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>keyword</td><td>User-defined name, 1 through 24 characters in length. The first character must be alphabetic.

Remarks:  

1. If TYPE, LOCATION, and EXPRESSION are omitted, the default data type is Integer and the default value is zero.   
2. If EXPRESSION is omitted, an internal default willbe assgned to the keyword/cellname based or the LOCATION (See The NASTRAN Statement for a list of internal default values).   
3. A DEFINE statement that specifies a LOCATION is actually setting the default for a NASTRAN system cellI and therefore it is not necessary to also set the system cell value on a subsequent NASTRAN statement unlessthe user wishes to override the previous DEFINE statement setting. Also, since more than one DEFINE statement may be present for the same “keyword", the last specification takes precedence.“Keywords" referenced on a NASTRAN statement, or in an expression on the DEFINE statement, are automaticaly substituted by the last specification of the "keyword" prior to the current statement being processed.   
4. DEFINE statements may also be specified in runtime configuration (RC)files. See the MSC Nastrar   
2020 Installation and Operations Guide.   
5. System cells may also be set with the NASTRAN statement. In addition,they may be set or values returned with the DMAP PUTSYS and GETSYS functions and the PARAM module. See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide.   
6. Each operand within the expression willbe converted to the result type prior to the arithmetic operation. For example: the statement“DEFINE】 $J]=2.5+3.6$ TYPE ${\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\mathit{\varepsilon}}}}_{=}{\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\mathit{I}}}}^{\mathfrak{P}}$ would result in 2.5 and 3.6 being converted to 2 and 3, respectively, and the result of 5 would be assigned to JJ.  

# Examples:  

1. Change the default value for block size: DEFINE BUFFSIZE=4O97LOCATION $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ SYSTEM(1)   
2. Set the sparse matrix selection to forward-backward substitution only: DEFINE SPARSE $=16$ LOCATION $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ SYSTEM(126)  

3. Define the system cell keyword and default value for the maximum output line count and then reset it to another value on a NASTRAN statement. Note: The DEFINE statement would typically be placed in an RC file and the NASTRAN statement would be placed in the File Management Section whenever the user wants to override the DEFINE statement default setting.  

DEFINE MAXLINES $\c=$ 999999999 LOCATION $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ SYSTEM(9) NASTRAN MAXLINES $\c=$ 100000  

4. Define system cell that behave like“toggles," turning some feature on or off:  

DEFINE MESH=2 LOCATION $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ (31) DEFINE NOMESH $=0$ LOCATION $\mathbf{\tau}=$ (31) NASTRAN MESH  

ote: Since each subsequent DEFINE statement redefines the default value, the second DEFINE of system cellocation 31 sets the default value to 0. A NASTRAN statement can then be inserted in the input file to reset the MESH system cellback to a value of 2. This same technique can be used with any system cell where the user wishes to refer to the system cell keyword and have the system cell set to a previous DEFINE statement default.  

5. Invalid usage of the DEFINE and NASTRAN statement:  

DEFINE BUFFSIZE $\c=$ 4097   
NASTRAN BUFFSIZE=2048  

Valid usage:  

DEFINE BUFFSIZE $\c=$ 4097 LOCATION $\c=$ SYSTEM(1) NASTRAN BUFFSIZE=2048  

Terminates the job at a user-specified location in the FMS Section.

Remark: ENDJOB is normally used after a DBDICT statement, or after database initialization.  

Concatenates additional DBset members on an existing permanent DBset previously defined with an INIT statement.  

Format:  

EXPAND dbset-name LOGICAL $\v{x}_{1}=$ ( log-namei [(max-sizei)]..)  

Example:  

ASSIGN DBMEM02 $={\overrightarrow{\mathbf{\Gamma}}}$ physical file name? EXPAND DBALL LOGICAL $\c=$ (DBMEM02)  

This would create and add the DBset member DBMEM02 to the existing DBset DBALL.

# Remark:  

1. On all computers with dynamic file allocation, the physical filename of a DBset member may be specified on an ASSIGN statement:  

ASSIGN log-name $\c=$ physical filename'  

If an ASSIGN statement is not specified for the member, then a name is automatically assigned. The naming convention is described in Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.  

Inserts an external file into the input file.The INCLUDE statement may appear anywhere within the input data file.  

Format: INCLUDE 'filename'  

Example:   
The following INCLUDE statement is used to obtain the bulk data from another file called   
MYBULK.DATA:   
SOL 101   
CEND   
TITLE $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ STATIC ANALYSIS   
LOAD $\mathbf{\lambda}=\mathbf{\lambda}\perp00$   
BEGIN BULK   
INCLUDE 'MYBULK.DATA'   
ENDDATA

Remarks:  

1. INCLUDE statements may be nested; that is, INCLUDE statements may appear inside the externa file. The nested depth level must not be greater than 10.   
2. The total length of any line in an INCLUDE statement must not exceed 72 characters. Long file names may be split across multiple lines. For example, the file: /dir123/dir456/dir789/filename.dat may be included with the following input: INCLUDE /dir123 /dir456 /dir789/filename.dat'   
3. See the MSC Nastran 2020 Installation and Operations Guide for more examnles.  

Creates a temporary or permanent DBset. For the SCRATCH and MASTER DBsets, allor some of their space may be allocated to real memory.  

Format 1: Initialize any DBset except MASTER and SCRATCH: INIT DBset-name[LOGICAL $\v{x}_{1}=$ (log-namei(max-sizei),..) BUFFSIZE=b CLUSTER $\scriptstyle.=c$ 一  

Format 2: Initialize the MASTER DBset: INI $\Gamma\mathbf{MASTER}\left[\left(\begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{RAM=r}}\\ {\mathbf{NORAM}}\end{array},\mathbf{S}\right)\mathbf{LOGICAL}=(\mathrm{log-name}(\mathrm{max-sizei}),\mathbf{\Lambda...}),}\end{array}\right)$ $\mathrm{{BUFFSIZE}={\bf b}\quad\mathrm{CLUSTER=c\bf{\tau}]}}$  

Format 3: Initialize the SCRATCH DBset: $\mathrm{INITSCRATCH}\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}{\mathrm{MEM=m}}\\ {\mathrm{NOMEM}}\end{array}\right)\mathrm{LOGICAL}=(\mathrm{log-name}(\mathrm{max-sizei}),...),\right.$ SCR300 $\O=$ (log-namei(max-sizei)...） BUFFSIZE $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{b} $ CLUSTER $\mathtt{\Omega}=\mathtt{c}$ ]  

Example:  

1. Modify the default allocation of the DBALL DBset to 50000 blocks: INIT DBALL LOGI $\c=$ (DBALL(50000)) 2. Do not allocate any real memory for the MASTER and SCRATCH DBsets:  

INIT MASTER(NORAM) INIT SCRATCH (NOMEM)  

3. Create a new DBset called DBUP with two members DBUP1 and DBUP2:  

INIT DBUP LOGI $\dot{.}=\dot{}$ (DBUP1, DBUP2) ASSIGN DBUP1 $\mathbf{\Psi}=\mathbf{\dot{\Psi}}$ physical filename 1' ASSIGN DBUP2 $={\overrightarrow{}$ physical filename 2'

For example, $100\mathrm{MB}=100$ megabytes, $1.5\mathrm{GB}=1.5$ gigabytes $=1536$ megabytes, and $2.5\mathrm{M}=2.5$ megawords $=2560$ kilowords. The size of a block in words is defined by BUFFSlZE. The default for DBALL and SCRATCH may be found in the MSC Nastran 2020 Instalation and Operations Guide and ranges from 250,000 blocks to 4,000,000 blocks.  

${\mathrm{RAM}}{=}\mathbf{r}$ requests that r words of real memory are to be allocated for the MASTER DBset. See the nast20200 Command (p. 14) in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.

Remarks:  

1.The INIT statement and itsapplications are further discussed in Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
2. Four DBsets are predefined and automatically allocated by the program. Their DBset-names are MASTER, DBALL, SCRATCH, and OBJSCR, and they are described in Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
3. On all computers with dynamic file allocation, the physical filename of a DBset member may specified on an ASSIGN statement: ASSIGN log-name ${\bf\varepsilon}={\bf\varepsilon}^{\prime}$ physical filename' If an ASSIGN statement is not specified for the member, then a name is automatically assigned. The naming convention is described in Database Concepts in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
4.It is recommended that there be sufficient physical space to hold a DBset member should it reach its maximum size (max-sizei).The max-sizei may be converted to words by multiplying by b. A summary of space usage and allocation is printed at the end of the execution summary table.   
5.In restart runs, the INIT statement is ignored for preexisting permanent DBsets. The INIT statement is intended to be specified only in the run in which the DBset is being created.If more DBset members need to be added to the DBset, then the EXPAND statement is used.   
6.IfRAM or ${\mathrm{RAM}}=\mathbf{r}$ is specified and the run terminates because the computer operating system detects insufficient space or time, or the computer halts due to a power outage or operator interruption, then it may not be possible to restart from the database. See the DBUPDATE FMS statement.  

7． BUFFSIZE $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{b}$ and CLUSTER $\scriptstyle.=c$ must satisfy the following inequality:  

$$
b\leq\frac{64000}{c}+5
$$  

8. By default, the SCRATCH DBset is divided into two partitions: LOGICAL and SCR300. The LOGICAL partition, log-names after the LOGICAL keyword, are reserved for DMAP scratch data blocks, and the SCR300 partition for DMAP module internal scratch files.  

The maximum total number of log-names for LOGICAL and SCR300 is 20. For example, if LOGICAL has 8 log-names, then SCR300 can have no more than 12 log-names.   
If NASTRAN SYSTEM $(142)=1$ is specified, then the SCR300 partition is not created and internal scratch files, along with DMAP scratch data blocks, willreside on the LOGICAL partition. The default is $\mathrm{SYSTEM}(142)=2$ ，   
If NASTRAN SYSTEM(151)=1 is specified and the LOGICAL partition has reached its maximum size, then the SCR300 partition will be used. The default is $\mathrm{SYSTEM}(151)=0$ ·   
By default, the space specified for the SCR300 partition is released to the operating system aft each DMAP module is executed if the module used more than 100 blocks for internal scratch fil If 100 blocks is not a desirable threshold, then it may be changed by specifying NASTRAN $\mathrm{SYSTEM}(150)=\mathrm{t}$ , where t is the number of blocks for the threshold.  

9．BUFFSIZE $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{b}$ is predefined for DBset-names MSCOBJ, OBJSCR, and USROBJ and may not be changed by BUFFSIZE on this statement or if the NASTRAN BUFFSIZE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ bmax statement (see The NASTRAN Statement (Optional) (p. 14) in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide). The default for b is recommended for all except very large problems. bmax must reflect the maximum of b specified for all DBsets attached to the run, including the delivery database.See MSC Nastran 2020 Instalation and Operations Guide for the defaults of b and bmax.  

10． If INIT MASTER $\mathrm{\RAM=r},$ ） and INIT SCRATCH(MEM=m) are specified, then BUFFSIZE for these DBsets must be the same. If not, a warning messge is issued, and the BUFFSlZE for the SCRATCH DBset is reset to that of the MASTER DBset.  

11. Only one INIT statement per dbset-name may be specified in the File Management Section.  

Specifies a list of scratch datablocks that may reside in scratch memory (SMEM).  

Format:  

MEMLIST DATABLK $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ (DBnamel, DBname2, .., DBnamei)  

# Example:  

MEMLIST DATABLK $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ (KOO，MOO，KQQ，MQQ)   
If generated, datablocks KOO, MOO, KQQ, and MQQ willreside in scratch memory. All other datablocks will be excluded from scratch memory.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>DBnamei</td><td>Name of a Nastran datablock.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. Only NDDL and local scratch datablocks may be included in MEMLIST specification.   
2. Datablocks specified will reside in SMEM on a first-come, first-served basis.   
3. Datablocks not specified by this statement will not reside in SMEM.   
4. Database directories for the SCRATCH DBset reside in SMEM and are not afected by any MEMLIST specification.   
5. Continuation lines are allowed.   
6. Multiple MEMLIST statementss are honored.   
7. Scratch I/O activity is reported in the .f4 file by including DIAG 42 in the Executive Control Section.  

Defines the current or default project identifier, project-ID  

Format: PROJ $\scriptstyle{\left[=\right]}$ 'project-ID'  

Examples:  

1. $\mathrm{PROJ}=\mathrm{^{\circ}M Y}.$ JOB'   
2. The following project-ID will be truncated to 40 characters: PROJ 'CAR MODEL 1999 BODY FRAME SYM － PROTYP B RUN' and all subsequent restarts must have the statement. PROJ ‘CAR MODEL 1999 BODY FRAME SYM － PROTYP B'  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>project-ID</td><td>Project identifier. Must be enclosed in single quotes.(Character string, maximum of 40 characters; Default=blank)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. There may be only one PROJECT statement in the File Management Section. The PROJECT statement must be specified before all DBCLEAN, DBDICT, RESTART, DBLOCATE, and DBLOAD statements where project-ID is not specified by the user.   
2.This statement is optional and specifies that alldatablocks and parameters to be stored on or accessed from the database in the current run shallalso be identified by project-ID.Therefore, in subsequent runs that may accessthis data through other FMS statements such as RESTART,the project-ID must be specified.   
3. Project-ID is the default on DBCLEAN, DBDICT, and RESTART FMS statements and in the WHERE and CONVERT clause of the DBLOCATE statement.   
4.Leading blanks and trailing blanks enclosed within the single quotes are ignored.All other blanks are considered part of the project-ID.   
5. Project-ID is saved with only the first 40 characters specified.  

Requests that data stored in a previous run be used in the current run.  

Format:  

$$
\Gamma\left[\mathrm{PROJECT^{-\prime}p r o j e c t^{\prime}~\mathrm{{VERSION}=\left[\Psi_{\mathbf{LAST}}^{\mathrm{Version-ID}}\right]\left[\underbrace{\mathrm{KEEP}}_{\mathrm{NOKEEP}}\right]\mathrm{{~LOGICAL}=\mathbf{dbname}}}_{\mathrm{LAST}}}\right]
$$  

# Examples:  

1.RESTART VERSION $^{\cdot}=7$ Version number 7 willbe retrieved for this run (version 8).At the end ofthe run, version 7 will be deleted.   
2． $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{PROJ}}={\prime}$ FENDER' RESTART The last version under project-ID FENDER willbe used in the current run.   
3. ASSIGN RUN1 $\scriptstyle=^{\prime}$ runl.MASTER' RESTART LOGICAL $\c=$ RUN1 The runl.MASTER and its associated database willbe used (read only) for restart purposes.

Remarks:  

1. There may only be one RESTART statement in the File Management Section.   
2. A new version-ID is automatically assigned whenever a restart is performed.  

3.If project-ID or version-ID or both are specified and cannot be found, then a fatal message will be issued.   
4. The RESTART statement is required to perform restarts in solution sequences 4, and 101 through 200 and SOL 400.   
5.If PROJECT is not specified, then the run will restart from the project-ID specified on the PROJ statement (See Example 2.).   
6.Databases created in one version typically cannot be directly restarted into a different version. Restrictions are typically documented in the current release guide; however, a DBLOCATE type restart might work.   
7. Restarts do not work with DMP.Restarts do not work with ACMS for versions released before 2018   
8. If NASTRAN IFPSTAR $\c=$ YES (default) and scr $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ no then the Bulk Data images will be stored on the IFPDAT file; for example, if the inputfile name is runl then runl.IFPDAT willbe created along with runl.MASTER and runl.DBALL. Please note the following when performing a restart. a. If runl.IFPDAT,runl.MASTER and runl.DBALL are in the same folder then only the MASTER file needs to be specified on an ASSIGN statement. For example, ASSI cold $\c=\dot{}$ runl.MASTER' RESTART LOG $\c=$ cold b. If runl.IFPDAT is in a different folder than that of runl.MASTER and runl.DBALL (or IFPDAT has been renamed in the same folder) then both the MASTER and IFPDAT must specified on ASSIGN statements and the IMPORT keyword must be specified on the ASSIGN IFPDB statement: ASSI cold $\mathbf{\Psi}=\mathbf{\dot{\Psi}}$ run1.MASTER' RESTARTLOG $\v{x}=$ cold ASSI IFPDB $=^{\dagger}$ other_folder/run1.IFPDAT' IMPORT  

9. For SOL 4OO one must also use NLRESTART (Case).  

10.Thedatabase is not suitable for restart ifany of the followingwas specified inthe cold start.Ifa restart is attempted then the program will issue User Fatal Message 9061.  

a. EXTSEOUT(DMIGDB or MATDB or MATRIXDB) without defining DBEXT. b． scr $\c=$ post

# Executive Control Section  

This section describes the Executive Control statements.These statements select a solution sequence and various diagnostics.  

Most Executive Control statements are order independent.The exceptions are the COMPILE, COMPILER, ALTER,ENDALTER, and LINK statements. If used, the LINK statement must appear after allCOMPILE statements. The COMPILER statement (or equivalent DIAGs) must appear before all COMPILE statements. The COMPILER statement also sets the defaults for subsequent COMPILE statements.  

# Executive Control Statement Summary  

The Executive Control statements are summarized as follows:  

ALTER Specifies deletion and/or insertion of the DMAP statements that follow.   
APP Specifies an approach in a solution sequence.   
CEND Designates the end of the Executive Control statements.   
COMPILE Requests compilation of specified subDMAPs or the NDDL file.   
COMPILER Specifies DMAP compilation diagnostics.   
DIAG Requests diagnostic output or modifies operational parameters.   
DOMAINSOLVER Selects domain decomposition solution methods.   
ECHO Controls the echo of Executive Control statements.   
ENDALTER Designates the end of a DMAP sequence headed by an ALTER.   
GEOMCHECK Specifies tolerance values and options for optional finite element geometry tests.   
ID Specifies a comment.   
LINK Requests the link of a main subDMAP.   
MALTER Inserts and/or deletes DMAP statements in solution sequences MODEL_CHECK Specifies model checkout run options.

# Remarks  

The remarks in the remarks section are generall arranged in order of importance and indicate such things as the Executive Control statement's relationship to other statements, restrictions and recommendations on its use, and further descriptions of the describers.  

Used to insert comments into the input file. Comment statements may appear anywhere within the input file.  

Format: $\$8$ followed by any characters out to column 80.  

Example:  

$\$5$ TEST FIXTURE-THIRD MODE  

Remarks:  

1. Comments are ignored by the program.   
2. Comments will appear only in the unsorted echo of the bulk data.  

Inserts and/or deletes DMAP statements in a subDMAP  

Format:  

ALTER kl [,k2]   
or   
ALTER ‘stringl'[(occurrence,offset)] ,['string2'[(occurrence,offset)]   
］   
or   
ALTER kl ，['string2'[(occurrence,offset)] ]   
or   
ALTER‘stringl'[(occurrence,offset)]，[k2]  

Examples:  

1. The following alter will insert a MATPRN DMAP statement after the first occurrence of the string 'SDR2' in subDMAP DSASTAT:  

SOL 101   
COMPILE DSASTAT $\$5$   
ALTER‘SDR2’\$   
MATPRN OESDS1//\$   
CEND  

2. The following alter will delete the second occurrence of the OUTPUT4 DMAP statement in subDMAP DSASTAT and replace it with a MATPRN DMAP statement:  

SOL 101  
COMPILE DSASTAT $\$5$   
ALTER‘OUTPUT4’（2），'OUTPUT4’（2）\$  
$\$5$ OR  
$\$5$ ALTER'OUTPUT4'（2）,'’\$

#  

Remarks: 1. The ALTER statement must be used in conjunction with the COMPILE Executive Control statement.Note: ALTER statements cannot be used in conjunction with an MALTER statement, and therefore should never immediately follow this statement. 2. If an MALTER statement is used in conjunction with the ALTER statement, then the MALTER should be placed above the COMPILE statements. Failure to place the MALTER in this position may cause ALTER statements to be ignored. 3. The ALTERs can reference the DMAP statements in any order within a subDMAP.Two restrictions on ordering are: K2 or'string2'(occurence, offset) references must refer to a DMAP statement number that is greater than or equal to the kl or 'stringl'(occurrence,offset) reference within a single ALTER statement. ·K1 or'stringl' and k2 or'string2' cannot overlap DMAP line positions with another ALTER that references the same subDMAP. 4.The'stringl'or'string2'used as asearch pattern willapplytoone complete DMAP statement; i.e.,a multiline DMAP statement willbe searched for a pattern match as if each 72 character line of the DMAP statement were concatenated together into one string-all blanks and comments either embedded or immediately preceding the DMAP statement, willbe retained. However, comments are ignored for the following type of alter: alter $\begin{array}{r l}{\mathbf{\lambda}\backsim}&{{}\star_{\mathbf{\lambda}\mathbf{\lambda}\mathbf{\mathcal{GPO}}}\lambda}\end{array}$ 5. Within a SUBDMAP, both 'stringl' and 'string2' will be used to search fora pattern match starting at the beginning of the subDMAP-not at the current position of the last string match. 6. The special characters (metacharacters) used for string searching are described in Remark 9. The characters $<,>$ and $\$8$ which are common DMAP characters, are also special metacharacters. If they are to be used in the search string as regular characters, then they must be preceded by a backward slash $(\backslash)$ . For example, to find the string IF(DDRMM $>=-1$ ） the command is ALTER $^{\prime}\mathrm{~I~F~}\:\:\left(\mathrm{DDRMM~}\:\:\backslash\:>=-1\:\right)\:^{\prime}\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:$ 7. The ALTER statement must not exceed 72 characters (no continuations are allowed).  

8.'string2' (r2,02)can be defaulted to 'stringl' (rl,01)by using a nullstring (").For example, the alter statement ALTER‘stringl'（rl,01）,'' is equivalent to ALTER‘stringl'(rl,0l),'stringl'(rl,01) The defaults for (r2,O2) using the null string can be overridden by specifying (r2,02).

Remark:  

1. CEND is an optional statement. If CEND is not specified, then the program will automatically inseri one.  

Requests the compilation of a subDMAP, subDMAP alter, or NDDL sequence.  

Format 1: Compiles a subDMAP or subDMAP alter sequence  

SUBDMAP   
COMPILE subDMAP-name [SOUIN $\c=$ souin-DBset SOUOUT $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ souout-DBset, DMAP   
OBJOUT $\c=$ objout-DBset LIST REF DECK NOLIST NOREF NODECK

# Examples:  

1. The following compiles an alter in subDMAP PHASEIDR: COMPILE PHASE1DR ALTER ‘CALL PHASE1A' CEND  

2. The following compiles a subDMAP called MYDMAP.(SUBDMAP and END are DMAP statements; see the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide):  

COMPILE MYDMAP LIST REF   
SUBDMAP MYDMAP $\$5$   
END S   
CEND  

3. The following obtains a listing of the NDDL:  

ACQUIRE NDDL   
COMPILE NDDL $\c=$ NDDL LIST   
CEND  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>subDMAP-name</td><td>The name of a subDMAP sequence. SubDMAP-name must be 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters in length and the first character must be alphabetic. The keywords DMAP and SUBDMAP are optional and do not have to be specified.</td></tr><tr><td>nddl-name</td><td>The name of an NDDL sequence (Character; l to 8 alphanumeric characters in length and the first character must be alphabetic). The keyword NDDL must be specified.</td></tr><tr><td>souin-DBset</td><td>The name of a DBset from which the subDMAP or NDDL source statements will be retrieved (Character; 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters in length and the first character must be alphabetic). The default is MSCSOU if the next statement is not a subDMAP statement.</td></tr><tr><td>souout-DBset</td><td>The name of a DBset on which the subDMAP or NDDL source statements will be stored (Character; 1 to 8 alphanumeric characters in length and the first character must be alphabetic). The default is the SCRATCH DBset.</td></tr><tr><td>objout-DBset</td><td>The name of a DBset on which the subDMAP object code will be stored (Character; l to 8 alphanumeric characters in length and the first character must be alphabetic). The default is the OBJSCR DBset.</td></tr><tr><td>LIST,NOLIST</td><td>LIST requests a compiled listing of the subDMAP or NDDL sequence. NOLIST suppresses the listing. NOLIST is the default.</td></tr><tr><td>REF,NOREF</td><td>REF requests a compiled cross reference of the subDMAP or NDDL sequence. NOREF suppresses the cross reference. NOREF is the default.</td></tr><tr><td>DECK,NODECK</td><td>DECK requests the subDMAP or NDDL source statements to be written to the PUNCH file. NODECK suppresses the writing to the PUNCH file. NODECK is the default.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. SubDMAP names for MSC Nastran solution sequences are given in the SOL statement description. The“COMPILER LIST REF" statement may be used to determine the appropriate subDMAP-name.   
2. If a subDMAP is being compiled and SOUIN $\c=$ souin-DBset is specified, then an ALTER Executive Control statement, or an INCLUDE statement which contains an ALTER statement as the first noncomment line, must appear immediately after this statement. If not, then the SUBDMAP DMAP statement must appear immediately after this statement.See the MSC Nastran DMAP Programmer's Guide.   
3. Starting in MSC/Nastran Version 69, DBsets USRSOU and USROBJ were no longer automatically created. They must be initialized by the INIT FMS statement and then may be specified for souin-dbset (or souout-dbset) and objout-dbset, respectively. They may be used to store the subDMAP source statements and object code on the primary database for reexecution in a subsequent run. Consider the following example:  

In the first run, the following COMPILE statement compiles and stores a subDMAP called MYDMAP:  

In the second run, the SOL statement is used to execute the MYDMAP stored in the previous run. The LINK statement is required to retrieve the object code from the USROBJ DBset:  

SOL MYDMAP   
LINK MYDMAP INCL $\c=$ USROBJ   
CEND  

In the third run, the COMPILE statement is used to alter MYDMAP and execute:  

SOL MYDMAP   
COMPILE MYDMAP SOUIN $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ USRSOU ALTER..   
CEND  

4. If SOUOUT or OBJOUT is specified and a subDMAP with the same name as subDMAP-name already exists on the database, then its source statements or object code will be replaced.  

5. A COMPILE statement is required for each subDMAP to be compiled. If two or more COMPILE statements reference the same subDMAP name,then only thelast is used in the linking of the object code. Ifthe COMPILE statement is being used only to alter a subDMAP and two or more COMPILE statements reference the same subDMAP name, then the multiple alters are assembled and the subDMAP is compiled only once.  

6. Only one COMPILE statement for an NDDL sequence may be specified in the input file.  

SOUIN $\c=$ souin-DBset requests only a compilation of the NDDL sequence stored on souin-DBset for purposes of obtaining alisting or a cross reference, and it cannot be modified with the ALTER statement. See Remark 3. COMPILE NDDL $\v{x}_{1}=$ NDDL SOUIN $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ MSCSOU LIST requests a listing of the MSC Nastran NDDL sequence. The ACQUIRE FMS statement or the SOL statement must be specified in order to attach the corresponding delivery database. To alter the MSC Nastran NDDL sequences, the entire modified NDDL sequence is included after the COMPILE statement, and SOUIN $\c=$ souin-DBset is not specified. SOUOUT $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ souout-DBset requests the storage of the NDDL source statements on the souout-DBset, and may not be specified with SOUIN $\stackrel{\cdot}{=}$ souin-DBset.  

7. The COMPILER statement may be used to override the defaults of NOLIST, NOREF, and NODECK. In other words, if LIST or NOLIST, REF or NOREF, or DECK or NODECK is not specified, then the corresponding option on the COMPILER statement willbe used. In the following example, REF on the COMPILER statement will override the default of NOREF on the COMPILE statement:  

COMPILER REF  

8. MSCSOU and MSCOBJ, specified with SOUOUT and OBJOUT, are special DBsets similar to USRSOU and USROBJ except that they are used in the creation or modification of a delivery database. For an example application, see the MSc Nastran 2020 Instalation and Operations Guide.  

Requests compilation of a DMAP sequence and/or overrides defaults on the COMPILE statement.  

Format:  

Example: COMPILER $\circleddash$ LIST   
1. REF is equivalent to DIAG 4. LIST is equivalent to DIAG 14. DECK is equivalent to DIAG 17.   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>LIST, NOLIST</td><td>LIST requests the compilation listing of the solution sequence. NOLIST suppresses the listing.</td></tr><tr><td>DECK,</td><td>DECK requests that the DMAP source statements of the solution sequence be written</td></tr><tr><td>NODECK</td><td>to the PUNCH file.NODECK suppresses the DECK option.</td></tr><tr><td>REF,NOREF</td><td>REF requests a compilation cross reference. NOREF suppresses a compilation cross reference.</td></tr><tr><td>GO,NOGO</td><td>GO requests the execution of the solution sequence following compilation. NOGO requests termination following compilation.</td></tr><tr><td>SORT, NOSORT</td><td>SORT compiles subDMAPs in alphabetical order. NOSORT compiles subDMAPs in calling sequence order.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

2. NOGO is an alternative to NOEXE on the SOL statement.   
3.This statement provides a means of obtaining a compilation or source listing, or both,of a complete solution sequence, including all the component subDMAPs.   
4. See the COMPILE statement to compile a single subDMAP.   
5. This statement also requests the automatic link of the solution sequence.Therefore, all objects must be created in the current run or obtained from the DBset such as USROBJ. See the COMPILE statement for how to create and store objects.   
6. The COMPILER statement may be used to override the defaults of NOLIST, NOREF, NODECK on the COMPILE entry when they are not explicitly specified. However, COMPILER LIST produces a list of the entire solution sequence. If a listing of only specific subdmaps is desired, then COMPILER LIST should not be specified and the LIST request should be made on the COMPILE entry. COMPILER REF COMPILE MYDMAP  

Requests diagnostic output or special options.  

Format: DIAG $[=]\operatorname{k1}[\operatorname{k2},...,\operatorname{kn}]$  

Examples: DIAG 8,53

Note that DOMAINSOLVER ACMS is not the default for the relevant solution sequences,but it is the recommended option for larger models for SOL 103, 111, 112, and 200 to obtain the best performance.  

# Remarks:  

1. Grid Point Weight Generator output selected by PARAM,GRDPNT or the WEIGHTCHECK Case Control command is not available when PARTOPT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ GRID.   
2. In SOL 20o, design sensitivity calculations may be performed in a distributed parallel environment in SOL 20O with the DSA keyword. It is a coarse parallel implementation that divides the sensitivity task across a number of processors so that each processes a subset of the total number of design variables.Folowing the sensitivity analysis and before optimization, the separate sensitivity data are appended into a global sensitivity set. Also, a. The dmp $\mathtt{\Gamma}=\mathtt{n}$ keyword must be specified on the Nastran submittal command where n is the number of available processors. b. The ACMS keyword may also be specified or modified along with DSA. For example, DOMAINSOLVERDSA,ACMS  

3.In SOL 400, the STAT method is used for DMP parallelism of matrix factorization and the NLSOLV method is used for DMP parallelism of the NLEMG process.The NLSOLV method is intended for nonlinear analysis using advanced nonlinear methods. To only use the STAT method or to change its option to use, for example, a different compression method, specify the following DOMAINSOLVER command:  

# DOMAINSOLVER STAT(COMPMETH $\c=$ GRID)  

Note that if STAT is changed as specified above, then the DMP paralelism for NLEMG will be turned off. If you want to change the STAT as described above and also keep NLSOLV for NLEMG parallelism, then use the following DOMAINSOLVER command:  

DOMAINSOLVER NLSOLV,STAT(COMPMETH $\dot{.}=\dot{}$ GRID)  

Note that this can equivalently be written as follows:  

DOMAINSOLVERNLSOLV  

DOMAINSOLVERSTAT(COMPMETH $\dot{.}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ GRID)  

Lastly, to only use the NLSOLV method for NLEMG parallelism, specify the following option: DOMAINSOLVERNLSOLV  

4. In SOL 40O, the DOMAINSOLVER NLSOLV (RUNOPT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ MULTIMST) is not supported in combination with Intel MKL Pardiso Solver option, i.e., SPARSESOLVER NLSOLV(FACTMETH $\c=$ PRDLDL).  

5. In SOL 11l, the MODES or ACMS option is used for DMP paralelism of the modal calculations and the FREQ option is used for the DMP parallelism of the frequency response calculations. The DOMAINSOLVER FREQ is always turned on for SOL 111. To use the ACMS option for the modal calculation, use the following DOMAINSOLVER command:  

DOMAINSOLVERACMS  

Furthermore, if the MODES option needs to be changed for SOL 111, then the correct approach is to include the following DOMAINSOLVER option:  

DOMAINSOLVER MODES(PARTOPT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ GRID).  

6. Residual vectors are not available when PARTOPT $\dot{\bf{\theta}}={\bf{\theta}}$ GRID.  

7. Dynamic parallel scheduling is available for ACMS and VERSION $\c=$ NEW. Dynamic scheduling provides better parallel speedup for larger numbers of threads. For NSMP less than or equal to 2, static scheduling is used regardless of the setting of SCHED.  

Controls the echo (printout) of the Executive Control Section.  

Formats: ECHOOFF ECHOON  

# Remarks:  

1. The ECHO statement is optional.   
2. ECHOOFF suppresses the echo of subsequent Executive Control statements. ECHOON reactivates the echo after an ECHOOFF statement.  

Designates the end of an alter.  

Format: ENDALTER  

Remark:  

1. The ENDALTER statement is required when using an alter unlessthe alter package ends with a CEND, COMPILE, or LINK statement.  

Specifies tolerance values and options for optional finite element geometry tests. Format:  

FATAL GEOMCHECK test_keyword $[=$ tol_value], [MSGLIMIT = n],|MSGTYPE $\O=$ INFORM WARN  

[SUMMARY], [ADVNLELM],[NONE]  

# Examples:  

1. Set the tolerance for the CQUAD4 element skew angle test to 15.0 degrees and limit messges to 50: GEOMCHECK Q4_SKEW $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ 15.0,MSGLIMIT $=50$   
2. Limit messages to 500 for each element type: GEOMCHECK MSGLIMIT $=500$   
3. Set the message type to fatal for CQUAD4 element taper tests: GEOMCHECK Q4_TAPER,MSGTYPE $\c=$ FATAL   
4. Request summary table output only using default tolerance values: GEOMCHECK SUMMARY   
5. Request advanced and conventional element geometry check output using default tolerance values:

# Remarks:  

1. The GEOMCHECK statement controls the number and severity of certain informational and warning messages produced by element matrix generation geometry checking operations. Controls are currently available for the CQUAD4, CQUADR, CTRIA3, CTRIAR, CHEXA, CPENTA, CTETRA, CPYRAM, CBAR, and CBEAM elements only. Multiple GEOMCHECK statement may be present. Continuations are acceptable.

where:  

·Test_keyword names starting with the characters Q4 are applicable to CQUAD4 and CQUADR elements. Test_keyword names starting with the characters T3 are applicable to CTRIA3 and CTRIAR elements. Test_keyword names starting with the characters TET_ are applicable to CTETRA elements. Test_keyword names starting with the characters $\mathrm{HEX_{-}}$ are applicable to CHEXA elements. Test_keyword names starting with the characters $\mathrm{PEN_{-}}$ are applicable to CPENTA elements. Test_keyword names starting with the characters PYR_ are applicable to CPYRAM elements.   
Skew angle for the quadrilateral element is defined to be the angle between the lines that join midpoints of the opposite sides of the quadrilateral. Skew angle for the triangular element is defined to be the smallest angle at any of the three vertices.   
Interior angles are defined to be the angles formed by the edges that meet at the corner node of an element. There are four for quadrilateral shapes and three for triangular shapes.   
Taper ratio for the quadrilateral element is defined to be the absolute value of [the ratio of the area of the triangle formed at each corner grid point to one half the area of the quadrilateral minus 1.0. The largest of the four ratios is compared against the tolerance value.Note that as the ratio approaches 0.0, the shape approaches a rectangle.   
Surface warping factor for a quadrilateral is defined to be the distance of the corner points of the element to the mean plane of the grid points divided by the average of the element diagonal lengths. For flat elements (such that all of the grid points lie in a plane), this factor is zero.   
The edge point length ratio and edge point included angle tests are only performed for the solid elements when edge node points exist. The length ratio test evaluates the relative position of the edge node point along a straight line connecting the two vertex nodes of that edge. Ideally, the edge point should be located on this line at a point midway between the two end points. The default tolerance allows the edge node to be positioned anywhere between the two quarter points on thi line. In addition, the angle between the lines joining the edge node and the end points is determined. If the angle is less than the tolerance (default is $150^{\circ}$ ), then the interior angle test is considered violated and a diagnostic message will be generated if appropriate.   
·The face warp coeffcient test tolerance is the cosine of the angle formed between the normal vectors located at diagonally opposite corner points on each face surface.This value is 1.0 for a face where allfour corners lie in a plane. The default tolerance allows angles of up to $45^{\circ}$ before a message is generated.   
3.A single line of output summarizing the results ofalltests for an element will be output if any of the geometry tests exceeds the test tolerance. Only the first n of these messages will be produced.A summary of the test results indicating the number of tolerances exceeded, as wellas the element producing the worst violation, is also output. If the SUMMARY keyword has been specified, only the summary table is produced and none of the single line element messages will be output.   
4.When SUMMARY is not specified, each geometry test that exceeds the tolerance willbe identified in the single line output summary by an indicator based on the specification for MSGTYPE. For the FATAL option, the indicator is “FAIL"; for the INFORM option, it is“xxxx"; for the WARN option, it is “WARN". If the FATAL option is specified and any test fails, the run is terminated.

Remarks:  

1. All DBsets specified on this statement must have the same BUFFSIZE. See the INIT, 98 FMS statement.  

2. SubDMAP objects are created with the COMPILE statement either in the current run or obtained from previous runs. The LINK statement collects objects in the following order:  

· Objects created with the COMPILE statement in the current run. · Objects residing on the DBset-name specified by the INCLUDE keyword. The default is MSCOBJ.  

3. Upon successfullinking of a subDMAP, the subDMAP may be executed with the SOL statement.  

4.The LINK statement must appear after all the COMPILE packages, if any.A compile package begins with the COMPILE statement and is delimited by the ENDALTER, CEND, LINK, or another COMPILE statement.  

5. The link table is necessary for COMPILER (or DIAG 4, 14, 17) Executive Control statement requests and the automatic link process.  

6. EXEOUT is useful in building delivery databases where executables are not to be saved.EXEOUT will be defaulted to the same DBset as specified by SOLOUT.

Depending on the sign, the specific DMAP statement may be above (-offset) or below (+offset) the referenced DMAP statement (Integer; Default = 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Remarks:  

1. If an MALTER statement is used in conjunction with the ALTER statement, then the MALTER should be placed above theCOMPILE statements.Failure to place the MALTER in this position may cause ALTER statements to be ignored.  

2. The MALTER statement can reference the DMAP statements in any order within a subDMAP.Twc restrictions on ordering are:  

●K2 or'string2'(occurence,offset) references must refer toa DMAP line number that is greater than  

or equal to the kl or 'stringl'(occurrence,offset) reference within a single MALTER statement. 'string1' and $\mathrm{k}2$ or 'string2' cannot overlap DMAP line positions with another MALTER that references the same subDMAP.   
3. The'stringl' or'string2' used as a search pattern willapply to one complete DMAP statement; i.e.,a multiline DMAP statement willbe searched for a pattern match as if each 72 character line of the DMAP statement were concatenated together into one string; all blanks and comments (either embedded or immediately preceding the DMAP statement) will be retained.   
4. The special characters used for string searching are described in Remark 9. The characters $<,>$ , and $\$8$ ,which are common DMAP characters, are also special metacharacters. If they are to be used in the search string as regular characters, then they must be preceded by a backward slash ().For example, to find the string IF (DDRMM >=-1) the command is ALTER'IF（DDRMM $\scriptstyle\gamma=-1$ )'\$   
5.'string2' (r2,O2)can be defaulted to 'stringl' (rl,01) by using anull string (").For example, the alte statement MALTER'stringl'(rl,01),'' is equivalent to MALTER‘stringl'(rl,0l),'stringl'(rl,01) The defaults for (r2,02) using the nullstring can be overridden by specifying (r2,02). As another example, the alter statement MALTER'stringl'(rl,01),''(r2,02) is equivalent to MALTER‘stringl'(rl,01),'stringl'(r2,02)   
6. The existing COMPILE statement options, such as LIST, XREF, SOUIN, etc.,cannot be directly specified on the new MALTER statement. They are obtained as follows: Ifa COMPILE statement exists for the subDMAP referenced by the MALTER, then options from this COMPILE statement will be used.  

Otherwise, they willbe taken from the COMPILER statement, with the exception that the LIST, and SORT option is always on.  

7. The MALTER string search order is as follows:  

● All COMPILE statement references that are part of the existing solution sequence (i.e., $S O L=$ are searched first.   
Then, allremaining subDMAPs in the solution sequence are searched in ascending alphabetical order.   
Within a subDMAP,both'stringl' and 'string2' will be used to search fora pattern match starting at the beginning of the subDMAP (not at the current position of the last string match).  

8. The MALTER statement must not exceed 72 characters (no continuations are allowed).  

9. Metacharacters:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>*</td><td>Matches any single character except newline.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Matches any number (including zero) of the single character (including a character specified by a regular expresson) that immediately precedes it. For example, since“."(dot) means any character, “.*" means“match any number of characters.”</td></tr><tr><td>[.] or<></td><td>Matches any one of the characters enclosed between the brackets. For example, “[AB]" matches either “A” or“B". A range of consecutive characters can be specified by separating the first and last characters in the range with a hyphen. For example“[A-Z]" will match any uppercase letter from A to Z and “[0-9]"</td></tr><tr><td>∧or!</td><td>will match any digit from 0 to 9. Some metacharacters lose special meaning inside brackets. A circumflex (^) as the first character in the bracket tries to match any one character not in the list. Requires that the following regular expression be found at the beginning of the</td></tr><tr><td>or</td><td>line.</td></tr><tr><td>$</td><td>Requires that the preceding regular expression be found at the end of the line.</td></tr><tr><td>一</td><td>Treats the following special character as an ordinary character. For example“\."</td></tr><tr><td>，</td><td>stands for a period and “\*" for an asterisk. Also, to search for a tic ('), the search string must be “\'".</td></tr><tr><td>Note:</td><td>Marks the beginning and end of a pattern to be matched. Nonportable characters such as [ ] and ^ should be replaced (e.g.,^→ ! and []→<>） if portability is required. However, all the preceding characters are</td></tr></table></body></html>  

10. Labels for use with the MALTER have been included in the solution sequences. See Table 1. These labels will be maintained in future versions and it is strongly suggested that alters which use the MALTER command take advantage of the unique MALTER labels. Use of the MALTER labels will significantly reduce the time required to convert alters between versions.

Remarks:  

1. The MODEL_CHECK statement is ignored in RESTART runs.   
2. The values specified for material properties using the MODEL_CHECK statement willbe used to temporarily update data for all MAT1, MAT2, MAT3, MAT8, and MAT9 Bulk Data entries only for the duration of the run. These values do not replace data specified on the MATi Bulk Data entries. Caution should be used when postprocessing results via the PARAM POST options since operations using inconsistent data could be performed. Furthermore, when layered composite element properties and materials (PSHELL and MAT2 MID1/MID2/MID3/MID4) are generated, these equivalent MAT2 property entries are not considered to be original input data and the effects of the MODEL_CHECK directives are permanently reflected in these MAT2 properties. Restarts should not be attempted in this case.   
3.System default values ofO.0 have been defined for each of the properties. The defaults can be changed using the following Nastran statement keywords: DEF_DENS for MAT_DENSITY, DEF_TECO for MAT_TECO, DEF_TEIJ for MAT_TEIJ, and DEF_DAMP for MAT_DAMPING.   
4.The MAT_TECO describer causes the direct components of the thermal expansion coefficient to be modified. The MAT_TEIJ describer causes the shear components of the thermal expansion coefficient to be modified.   
5. The CHECKOUT option has the same efect as a PARAM,CHECKOUT,YES Bulk Data entry.   
6. The following table summarizes the acceptable specifications for the PRINT item_list.

Remarks:  

1. If SOLIN keyword is not given and if there are no LINK statements within the input data, the program will perform an automatic link. The program willfirst collect the objects created in the current run by the COMPILE statement and the remaining objects stored in the MSCOBJ DBset. The program will then perform an automatic link of the collected objects.   
2. If the SOLIN keyword is not given but a LINK statement is provided, the SOLIN default will be obtained from the SOLOUT keyword on the LINK statement.   
3. The operation sequence control array (OSCAR) defines the problem solution sequence.The OSCAR consists ofa sequence of entries with each entry containing all of the information needed to execute one step of the problem solution. The OSCAR is generated from information supplied by the user's entries in the Executive Control Section.   
4. The SOLIN keyword willskip the automatic link and execute the OSCAR on the specified DBset   
5. The DOMAINSOLVER may be used in conjunction with solution sequences 101, 103, 108, and 111 to select domain decomposition solution methods.

SOL 600,ID is an Executive Control statement similar to SOL. The diference between SOL and SOL 600,ID is that the computations (element matrix formulations, matrix decomposition,etc.) will be performed by Marc rather than by Nastran.Inputs and outputs as much as possble willbe the same as (or similar to) the familiar Nastran inputs and outputs, however standard Marc inputs and outputs are also available.SOL 600 is primarily intended for nonlinear static and dynamic analysis of 3D structures that have already been manufactured and assembled. Although it has capabilities for 2D structures and for certain manufacturing processes,those capabilitiesshould only be used for“simple"cases.For more complex 2D and manufacturing analyses either a standalone version of Marc or SOL 40O is recommended.  

The SOL 60o,ID statement should normally be used only for nonlinear analysis, but it may also be used for certain classes of linear static or dynamic analyses.The recommended form of this command is shown with the options provided above. If entered with“SOL 600,ID"only, it acts just like SOL except a Marc input data file“jid.marc.dat"willbe generated("jid"is the name ofthe Nastran input file without the extension.) For example, if the Nastran input file is named abcd.dat, (or abcd.bdf) then “jid' $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ abcd.  

The required ID represents many valid solution sequence integer or names shown in Table 2 for the SOL statement. Examples are 106, 129, NLSTATIC, NLTRAN.The following solutions are not available: 107, 108,110,111,112, 114,115,116,118,144, 145,146,190,200,and 400 (and their equivalent names). Solutions specified in Table 2 of the SOL statement may be used.If the model has contact, ID must be 106, 129, 153, 159 or their equivalent names unless PERMGLUE is used.  

Although SOL 600 supports 2D analyses (axisymmetric and plane strain), the support is not complete. It is strongly recommended that 2D analyses use some other solution sequence.  

Most items on the SOL 600,ID after ID itself may be specified in environmental variables. This may be done any wayenvironmental variablescan be set.They may be set bythe Nastran user at run time or bythe system administrator when Nastran is installed. Any values specified on the SOL statement override those in the environment. Environmental variables are fully described in the MSC Nastran 2020 Instalation and Operations Guide.Akeywords file is availabletodescribe the format ofeach variable.The variable is normaly set in the system-widerc file, auser's rc file, alocal rc file or in ascript used to submit Nastran.Any string or value listed on the SOL 600,ID statement is also valid asan environmental variable. Ifthe environmental variables are placed in the system-wide rc file,they may be used by a company forallNastran users and even hide the fact that Marc is being spawned if so desired.  

The following environmental variables are available:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Environmental Variable</td><td>Item on SOL Statement</td></tr><tr><td>NASM_PATH</td><td>PATH</td></tr><tr><td>NASM_COPYR</td><td>COPYR</td></tr><tr><td>NASM_OUTR</td><td>OUTR</td></tr><tr><td>NASM_STOP</td><td>STOP</td></tr><tr><td>NASM_NOERROR</td><td>NOERROR</td></tr><tr><td>NASM_STRFILE</td><td>Path and name of marcfilt.txt file (see below)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

PATH  

PATH isan optional item which determines the location of the version of Marc to be executed.If PATH is omitted, the version of Marc included withNastran willbe used if itcan belocated. Inthis case, therunscript for Marc(run_marc or run_marc.bat) willbe expected to be in a directory under /MSC_BASE.MSC_BASE is an environmental variable set when Nastran first starts execution that defines the base instalation directory for Nastran. If for some reason MSC_BASE cannot be determined, the commands to spawn Marc wil fail and the user must re-run Nastran with one of the PATH options set or the NASM_PATH environmental option set to the desired location of Marc's tools directory.  

# PATH $\c=$ 1  

If $\mathrm{PATH}{=}1$ is specified, Nastran will determine the proper command to execute the companion program. To aid Nastran in determining the program's location, a file named marcrun.pth must be available in the same directory where the Nastran input file resides.The marcrun.pth file must contain one line providing the location (complete path)of the run_marc script.A typical example of the line in the file marcrun.pth would be  

# /mycomputer/marc200x/tools  

To this path is appended the string“/run_marc -jid name.marc -v no"and possbly other items to form th( complete string used to execute Marc.This complete string looks like the string shown in the following  

PATH $^{-3}$ example.Note that on Windows systems, substitute a back slash for the forward slashes shown. Do not terminate the line with a forward slash or back slash.  

PATH $\scriptstyle\left|=2\right.$  

If PATH $_{.=2}$ is specified, it is expected that the directory with the run_marc script is on the PATH. If PATH $:-2$ is specified, Marc will be executed from inside Nastran using the command:  

run_marc -jid jid.marc.dat -v no  

PATH=3  

When $\mathrm{PATH}{=}3$ is specified, the complete command to execute Marc must be contained in a file named marc.pth (lowercase). This file should typically contain one line of the form:  

/mycomputer/marc200x/tools/run_marc -jid name.marc -v no  

COPYR  

COPYR is an optional item. If COPYR is specified, Marc output files willbe copied to Nastran output files and/or deleted according to the options shown in the following table:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>COPYR Option</td><td>Copy Marc Output Files to Nastran Output Files</td><td>Delete Marc Input & Output Files</td></tr><tr><td>O (default)</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>1 or -1 (see below)</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>2 or -2 (see below)</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table></body></html>  

If COPYR is 1 or 2, Marc's out and log files will be copied exactly as produced by Marc.  

If COPYR is -1 or -2 the actions as shown above for $+1$ or $^{+2}$ will occur, and Marc-type text will be converted to Nastran-type text (or any other desired text) using an ASCIl file named marcfilt.txt.This file must be located in the same directory where the Nastran input resides or in the same directory where the Marc executable resides.The marcfilt.txt file can contain as many lines as desired like the one shown below:  

"Marc string 1" "Replacement String 1" "Marc string 2" "Replacement String 2"  

That is,each line contains two strings.Each string starts and ends with a double quote sign (").The Marc string must match the exact content and case as found in the Marc .out or .log files.The replacement string may be any string desired and can be the same length,shorter or longer than theMarc string.The two strings must be separated by at least one space, but more spaces are acceptable. Line lengths for marcfilt.txt, as wel as Marc's .out and .log files are limited to 200 characters for the text replacement option.  

The following Marc files are potentially affected by the COPYR option:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Marc OutputFile</td><td>Nastran Output Copied to</td><td>COPYR</td></tr><tr><td>name.marc.out</td><td>name.f06</td><td>1,2,-1,-2</td></tr><tr><td> name.marc.log</td><td> name.log</td><td>1, 2,-1,-2</td></tr><tr><td>name.marc.t16</td><td>Not copied, will remain if produced</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>name.op2, fort.11 or ftnl1</td><td>Not copied, will remain if produced</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# MARCEXE $\c=$ SOLVE  

MARCEXE $\v{x}_{\mathrm{{,}}}=$ SOLVE is an optional item. If MARCEXE is entered, an existing input file named jid.marc.dat is assumed to exist in the directory where therunwassubmitted. Nastran willexecuteMarc using the existing jid.marc.dat file.A new Marc file willnot be created. Other options available when MARCEXE is used are PATH and OUTR. Options not available with MARCEXE are COPYR, STOP, NOEXIT, NOERROR and CONTINUE. Beware that the original jid.marc.dat willbe renamed to jid.marc.dat.l automatically by Nastran just like an existing jid.fo6 is renamed to jid.f06.1  

# NOERROR  

NOERROR is an optional item. If NOERROR is specified, errors due to features that are available in Nastran but not available in Marc, and/or features not yet supported bythe translator willbe ignored (see Restrictions and Limitations). If NOERROR is entered and $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}2 Ḍ$ (or 3) is not specified, Marc will be executed even though the complete Nastran model may not have been completely translated. We recommend that NOERROR only be used by experienced analysts and then only with extreme caution.  

# MSGMESH  

MSGMESH is an optional item and should be omitted unless the Bulk Data contains some entries in the MSGMESH format. If there are any MSGMESH entries present, set MSGMESH $\c=$ Nhigh, where Nhigh is an integer equal to the largest node, element, material or property in the model (after MSGMESH entries have been expanded). Optionally this item can be set as an environmental variable $\mathrm{S600\_M001=Nhigh}$ . If MSGMESH entries are presentand neither S600_M001 nor MSGMESH on the SOL 600 statement are set, the job willterminate with an appropriate messge.  

# NOEXIT  

NOEXIT is an optional item. If entered, the DMAP generated“on the fly" to process the OUTR options will not contain EXIT and Nastran will proceed. This means in most cases, the Nastran solution as wellas the Marc solution willoccur. If.fO6 is specified as one of the OUTR options, this could cause confusing output as both the Marcand Nastran results willbe in the .fO6 file.Confusion could also result from both outputs being in .op2, .xdb and/or .pch files.Therefore, this option should only be used with great care.  

Listing of the DMAP generated on the fly for SOL 600 can be suppressed by placing ECHOOFF just afte the SOL 600 entry.  

# Restrictions:  

OUTR options may not be used with restart jobs.   
OUTR options are not available for SOL 600 2D analysis such as axisymmetric or plane strain.   
$\blacktriangledown$ OUTR options are not available for SOL 600 heat transfer.   
Spaces in the list of OUTR items are not allowed.  

OUTR  

OUTR is an optional item.If OUTR is specified, Marc output results willbe converted to various types of Nastran formats.The OUT option on the Nastran command should not be used with any OUTR options. The type of output to be produced depends on the OUTR options entered as wellas any DMAP entered in the executive control. If OUTR is omitted, no Marc output willbe brought back into Nastran, but standard Marc .out,.tl6 and/or .tl9as well as an op2 file willbe available depending on the options selected with PARAM,MARCT16, PARAM,MARCT19 and other options.OUTR options may not be used with restart jobs.  

The following options are available:  

Option 1 -- Specify a String of Desired Output Types (Preferred Method) OUTR $\v{x}=$ OP2,F11,F06,PCH,XDB,T16,T19,PST  

Use any or allof the above to request the following options except that both OP2 and XDB should not b entered:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>OP2</td><td>Create output2 file named jid.op2 consisting of input model and output results datablocks.</td></tr><tr><td>F11</td><td>This option requires PARAM,POST,-1 or PARAM,POST,-2 in the Bulk Data.

:db 3D Contact will be output in one of the datablocks described below:  

Store output in OESNLBR and OESNLXR (OESNLXR will be empty like SOL 106)   
Store output in OESNLBR   
Store output in OESNLBD   
Store output in OESNLXD   
1. SOL 106 outputs both OESNLBR and OESNLXR but OESNLXR is empty.   
2. SOL 129 only outputs the OESNLXD datablock and it is empty.   
3. Case Control BOUTPUT is also required to obtain this type of output   
4. The default is O if contact is present in the model and OUTR $\v{x}=$ op2 (or .xdb, punch and/or .f06).   
5. This option is specified like the example shown: OUTR $\vDash$ OP2,F06,CDB=0   
6. The datablocks have the same names and type of information whether executing SOL 600,106 or SOL 600,129.  

Option 2 -- Specify an Integer to Select Certain Options (Not Recommended)  

$\scriptstyle\mathrm{OUTR=1}$ or 2 and an op2 file named fort.1l or ftnll will be produced and DMAP as shown below is required to bring the Marc output results back into the Nastran database.

IfOUTR $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ -1,-2,-16,-166, -266,-366,-19,-199, -299 or $-399$ only the output conversion process takes place. An Marc input file is not produced, Marc is not spawned from Nastran,but .op2,.xdb, pch and/or .f06 resultscan be produced. For such cases,the Case Controland Bulk Data files can be dummies (for example, they can contain several nodes and one element) or a fullfile could be used. These options are handy if Marc is run by modifying the Marc input file (jid.marc.dat) with an editor or for someone who creates Marc input and runs Marc outside the Nastran environment, but wants output in one ofthe Nastran formats (see Remark 6.)  

# STOP  

STOP is an optional item. STOP is used to prevent execution of Marcor exit Nastran after IFP,if so desired. DO NOT ENTER any of the STOP options if any of the OUTR options are entered as the DMAP generated automaticall by Nastran will put an EXIT in the proper place.The various options are as follows:  

# ${\mathsf{S T O P}}{=}0$  

If $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP=}0 Ḍ$ Nastran will not be stopped after Marc exits. Nastran willattempt to obtain its own solution to the problem if possible.Use of this option can lead to confusion because results from both Marc and Nastran will be available.If theMarc resultsare placed inthe .fO6fileand ifthe Nastran results arealso available in the .f06 file, it willbe difficult to tell which results came from Nastran and which results came from Marc. This also applies to .op2 files and .xdb files. It is suggested the $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP=}0 Ḍ$ option be used by extremely experienced SOL 600 users and even then with great care.  

$\mathsf{S T O P=}1$  

If $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}_{ Ḋ }=1 Ḍ$ Nastran will be gracefully stopped after IFP. This option is used to prevent Nastran from performing its own solution (normaly used when the solution is performed by the Marc). $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}1 Ḍ$ should be normally used if OUTR is not specified. $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}_{ Ḋ }=1 Ḍ$ is the default if no STOP, CONTINUE or OUTR options are entered.  

# $\mathsf{S T O P}{=}2$  

For ${\mathrm{STOP}}{=}2\ .$ Marc will not be executed. This option is used if you wish to examine the Marc input file and make changes prior to running Marc. However, if $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}2 Ḍ$ is entered, the OUTR options will not be available.  

$\mathsf{S T O P}{=}3$  

$S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}3 Ḍ$ is a combination of $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}1 Ḍ$ and $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}2.$ Nastran is stopped after IFP and Marc is not executed. This would be the normal STOP option if you want to examine a Marc input file, then execute Marc manually. The ${\mathrm{STOP}}{=}2$ option is normally used if you want to obtain comparative results between standard Nastran solutions and Marc solutions (in which case, allinput options must be fully supported by both programs). If $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}3 Ḍ$ is entered, the OUTR options will not be available.  

# CONTINUE=  

CONTINUE $\c=$ specifies an option as to how Nastran will continue its analysis after Marc finishes. For this to happen, do not enterany STOP or OUTR options. It is not usually posible to perform more than one of these operations if necessary.  

Nastran will continue the current solution sequence as normal. For example if SOL 600,106 is entered, SOL 106 will continue as normal after Marc finishes. Of course, no 3D contact or materials not supported by SOL 106 may be used.  

Nastran will switch to SOL 107 to compute complex eigenvalues. Marc will generate DMIG matrices for friction stiffness (and possibly damping) on a file specified by pram,marcfill,name and time specified by param,marcstif,time. This is accomplished by making a complete copy of the original Nastran input file and spawning off a new job with the SOL entry changed and an include entry for the DMIG file. The user must put CMETHOD and CEIG in the original Nastran input file.  

(Option not presently available.) Nastran will switch to SOL 107 to compute complex eigenvalues. Marc will generate OUTPUT4 matrices for friction stiffness (and possibly damping) on a file specified by pram,marcfil2,name and time specified by param,marcstif,time. This is accomplished by making a complete copy of the original Nastran input file and spawning of a new job with the SOL entry changed and an include entry for the DMIG file.  

The original Nastran file should include CMETHOD $\mid=$ id in the Case Control command and a matching EIGC entry in the Bulk Data.  

In addition, the DMIG entries specified by MDMIOUT will be included in a separate Nastran execution spawned from the original execution. Case Control and Bulk Data will be added to the original input to properly handle these matrices in the spawned Nastran execution.  

Same as option 1 except SOL 110 is run. For this option, the original Nastran input file must contain METHOD $\mid=$ ID1 and CMETHOD $\mid=$ ID2 in the Case Control as well as matching EIGRL (or EIGR) and EIGC entries in the Bulk Data.  

Same as option 1 except SOL 103 is run for real eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The database can be saved to restart into SOL 110 if desired. This should be done on the command line or in a rc file with scratch $\v{x}=$ no. For this situation, the original Nastran input file must include METHOD $\c=$ id in the Case Control command and a matching EIGRL or EIGR entry in the Bulk Data.(CMETHOD and EIGC can also be included.) The actual restart from SOL 103 to 110 must be performed manually at the present time.  

Continue options 10l to 400 are used to convert Marc's initial contact tying constraints to MPC's and then continue in SOL 101 to 112 as a standard Nastran execution. For example, if CONTINUE $_{\cdot=101}$ , a SOL 101 run with all the geometry load cases, etc. from the original run would be conducted with the addition of the initial contact MPC determined from Marc. The continue $=101+$ options are frequency used to model dissimilar meshes as well as glued contact which does not change throughout the analysis. This option can be used for any standard Nastran sequence where the initial contact condition does not change. In order for initial contact to work, the surfaces must be initially touching. If they are separated by a gap, the MPC's will be zero until the gap closes and thus the initial MPC's are zero. This option automatically sets BCPARA INITCON $\stackrel{\cdot}{=}1$ ，  

S670PT=NO  

If S67OPT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ NO is entered the following action will be taken for SOL 600 or SOL 700: TA1MCK and EMGPRO will not be disabled (when these routines are disabled, materials used only by SOL 600 or SOL 700 such as MATG, MATF, MATHP, etc.may be in the model and the tl6op2 conversion will take place, otherwise the job willfail with a FATAL ERROR).Also, Case Control FATAL error termination will occur at the same place as other Nastran Solution Sequences. If S67OPT $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ YES or S67OPT is omitted entirely, TA1MCK and EMGPRO willbe disabled and Case Control FATAL ERRORS will cause job termination immediately. S67OPT $\dot{\bf{\theta}}={\bf{\theta}}$ YES is the default.  

# SCRATCH=  

Determines what will happen when a SOL 600 job is initiated with SOL 600 database files (\*.3dc, \*.prp) present in the run directory (this usualy means another job is running and conflicts can occur.)The default is SCRATCH $\dot{}=\dot{}$ WAIT01. Options are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>SCRATCH=DELETE</td><td>Attempt to delete all *.3dc and *.prp files, continue with present job. If the attempt to delete them fails, the job will terminate with an appropriate message.</td></tr><tr><td>SCRATCH=ABORT</td><td>If any *.3dc or *.prp files are found, abort the present job with an appropriate message.</td></tr><tr><td>SCRATCH=WAIT</td><td>If any *.3dc or *.prp files are found, wait until they disappear, then begin current run. This option will wait an “indefinite” amount of time.</td></tr><tr><td>SCRATCH=WAITxx</td><td>If any *.3dc or *.prp files are found, wait for xx minutes or until they disappear, then begin current job. If they do not disappear within xx minutes, abort the current job with an appropriate message. Examples, to wait up to 1 minute, enter SCRATCH=WAITOl, to wait up to 15 minutes, enter SCRATCH=WAIT15. Note: xx can range from 01 to 99.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

SCRATCH $\c=$ Remarks:  

1. For the WAIT options, if no \*.3dc or \*.prp files are found, the job will start immediately.   
2. No spaces are allowed.  

# TSOLVE  

Determines which“solver"(Nastran or Marc) is used to solve a heat transfer analysis.The default is Nastran.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TSOLVE=M TSOLVE=MS</td><td>Marc is used as the thermal solver.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Marc is used as the thermal solver followed by a structural analysis using the temperatures from the end of thermal analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>TSOLVE=N</td><td>Nastran is used as the thermal solver (default).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# TSOLVE Remarks:  

1. If the default is used and thermal contact is present, SOL 60O spawns Marc to calculate initial thermal contact variables which are then read by Nastran, turned into Nastran CELAS and other variables. A second Nastran run is spawned for the primary Nastran run to complete the heat transfer calculations.   
2. If OUT or OUTDIR are used with thermal contact in SOL 60O they must both reference the same directory.   
3. This option should be entered for heat transfer analysis only.  

# SMEAR  

The term SMEAR, as used by SOL 6O0,is diferent then that used on the PCOMP Bulk Data entry. For SOL 600, SMEAR is the same as LAM $\dot{.}=\dot{}$ BLANK on the PCOMP entry. Other LAM options are not available using SOL 600, however complete integration and fast integration methods are available, seethe PCOMPF Bulk Data entry.  

If the string SMEAR is entered on the SOL 600,ID command line, composite shell entries using PCOMP will use the smeared approach.If SMEAR is not entered, thethrough-the-thicknessintegration approach will be used.The smeared approach is identical to other Nastran solution sequences where PCOMP entries are converted to PSHEL and MAT2 entries. The through-the-thicknessintegration approach is more accurate for post-buckling and nonlinear analyses but takes more computer time.OP2.fO6 and punch outputs are available and are controlled by the OUTR options OUTR $\vDash$ xxx where xxx is .op2, .f06 and/or .pch. If any OUTR options are specified, .op2 must be included. In addition, standard Case Control requests are required.  

# SMEAR Option Restrictions  

1. The SMEAR option may only be used if allcomposite materials in the model are made of shell elements (if there are any composite solid elements, this option may not be used.)   
2. Case Control requests for DISP(options $\mathbf{\tau}_{=\mathrm{ALL}}$ , the STRESS(options $\begin{array}{r}{{\bf\Pi}=\frac{{\bf\Pi}}{\bf\Pi}}\end{array}$ ALL must be entered. STRAIN(options) $\mid=.$ ALL is optional. (options) consist of any combination of (print,plot,punch)   
3. The SMEAR output options may not be controlled using sets.   
4.It is suggested that the Marc tl6 file be limited to only those output“items"absolutely necessary a composite output can be large and take significant computer time.   
5. If OUT or OUTDIR are used with this option, they must reference the same directory.  

# PERMGLUE  

Specify PERMGLUE if permanent glued contact is to be used. Permanent glued contact is glued contact where the glued condition is determined using initial contact.This glued condition willremain throughout the analysis.The MPC's produced by the PERMGLUE option are identical to those formed in SOL 101 or SOL 103 when the permanent glue option is specified. When this option is used, set BCONTACT $\mathbf{\partial}=.$ ALLGLUP. For SOL 600, the PERMGLUE option is the only way contact can be used with SOL600,101 or SOL 600,103 or other “linear" analyses.  

# MRENUELE  

Determines if SOL 600 elements will be renumbered or not. (Default $=0$ ）  

0 No renumbering will occur (suggested for models with largest element number less than approximately 20000)   
1 All elements will be renumbered and the new numbers will be used in the Marc analysis. An equivalence list will be output on file elenum.txt   
2 All elements will be renumbered internally during translation, however the original element numbers will be used in the Marc input file and Marc analysis.  

Remarks concerning MRENUELE:  

1. MRENUELE must be set on the SOL 600 entry if the maximum element number is greater than 9,999,999.   
2.The $\"=\"$ and an integer of $^{\mathfrak{s}}0^{\mathfrak{s}}\{^{\mathfrak{s}}1^{\mathfrak{s}}$ or $^{\mathfrak{a}}2^{\mathfrak{n}}$ must follow“MRENUELE” with no spaces when MRENUELE is entered on the SOL 600 entry.   
3.If the maximum element is 9,999,999 or smaler MRENUELE may be set as a parameter in the bulk data or placed in a rc file.   
4. MRENUELE should not be set on the SOL 600 and as a parameter.   
5. For MRENUELE $_{,=1}$ an equivalence list of original and re-numbered element numbers is output on file elenum.txt  

# MRENUGRD  

Determines if SOL 600 grid ID's will be renumbered or not. (Default $=0$ 1  

0 No renumbering will occur (suggested for models with largest grid ID lessthan approximately 20000)   
1 All grid ID's will be renumbered and the new numbers will be used in the Marc analysis. An equivalence list will be output on file grdid.txt   
2 All grid ID's will be renumbered internally during translation, however the original element numbers will be used in the Marc input file and Marc analysis.  

Remarks concerning MREUGRD:  

1. MRENUGRD must be set on the SOL 600 entry if the maximum element number is greater than 9,999,999.   
2.The $\"=\"$ and an integer of $^{\mathfrak{s}}0^{\mathfrak{s}}\{^{\mathfrak{s}}1^{\mathfrak{s}}$ or $^{\mathfrak{a}}2^{\mathfrak{n}}$ must follow“MRENUELE” with no spaces when MRENUGRD is entered on the SOL 600 entry.   
3.If the maximum grid ID is 9,999,999 or smaller MRENUGRD may be set as a parameter in the bulk data or placed in a rc file.   
4. MRENUGRD should not be set on the SOL 6O0 and as a parameter.  

5. For MRENUGRD $^{\prime=1}$ an equivalence list of original and re-numbered grid id's is output on file gridnum.txt  

# MRENUMBR  

Determines both grid and element ID's for SOL 600 will be renumbered or not. (Default $=0$  

<html><body><table><tr><td>0</td><td>No renumbering will occur (suggested for models with largest grid ID less than approximately 20000)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>All grid and element ID's will be renumbered and the new numbers will be used in the Marc analysis. An equivalence list will be output on file grdid.txt</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>All grid and element ID's willbe renumbered internally during translation, however the original element numbers will be used in the Marc input file and Marc analysis.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remark concerning MREUMBR: All remarks for MRENUELE and MRENUGRD apply.  

# S6news  

S6news can be set to YES orNO.If set toYES,alist ofnew features currentlyconsidered to bein betatests are output complete with the Case Control and/or Bulk Data descriptions anticipated once these featuresare released.  

# SYSabc  

Allows Nastran system cells to be set on the SOL 60o Executive Control statement if desired. Abc must be an integer ranging froml to 50O and be a valid system number. INTT must be an integer with 1-8 digits. More than one SYSabc $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ INTT statement may be made if so desired, however abc may not be repeated. Note that the limit on the integer following the equal sign is 8 digits.  

Running SOL 600 in Steps -- Modification of the SOL 60o Statement Using Environmental Variables:  

It is possible to run the main portions of SOL 600 in single steps without changing the Nastran input file. This is accomplished using one of thetwo environmental variables discussed below. A user can set these variables in a script that runs Nastran,from the commandlineor for Windows using the control panel. Note that on Linux systems, the name of the environmental variable must be in upper case.The string to which it is set can be in upper or lower case and will be converted to upper case.  

To Run SOL 60O in Three Steps Without Changing the SOL 6O0 Statement in the Input File:  

First, make sure that your SOL 600 input file has a SOL 600 statement that contains all of the features you would want if all steps were done in a single run. For example,ifyou wish to make an op2 file and place the results in the .fO6 file, a typical SOL 600 statement would be as follows:  

(if the default path to Marc is to be used).  

It is important to have the OUTR options specified at the end of the SOL 60O statement. The following environmental variable can be set as shown to run the three steps (a Linux shell example is shown):  

1． export MARC_RUN $\c=$ “stop'  

This will tell Nastran to run the internal Nastran-to-Marc translator only. The first SOL 600 statement shown would be changed internally just for this run above to the following:  

SOL 600,NLSTATIC PATH $_{\cdot=1}$ OUTR $\c=$ OP2,F06STOP=3  

This change will be shown in the .f06 file.  

2. export MARC_RUN $\c=$ “solv”  

This willtell Nastran to run Marc from inside Nastran. The first SOL 600 statement shown would be changed internally just for this run above to the following:  

SOL 600,NLSTATIC PATH $_{.=1}$ OUTR $\v{x}=$ OP2,F06MARCEXE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}=$ SOLVE  

For this run, it is assumed that a file named jid.marc.dat resides in the input file directory created from a previous translator-only run. The Nastran script willautomatically rename jid.marc.dat to jid.marc.dat.1, but the Nastran executive processing will name it back to jid.marc.dat  

3． export MARC_RUN $\mathbf{\Psi}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ “pst" This will tell Nastran to run the tl6 to op2 translator inside Nastran. The first SOL 600 statement shown would be changed internally just for this run above to the following  

# SOL 600,NLSTATICPATH $_{\cdot=1}$ OUTR $\v{x}=$ OP2,F06,PST  

For this run, it is assumed that a file named jid.marc.tl6 as wellas the original Nastran input file jid.dat resides in the input file. The“tl6"file should have been created from a previous Marc execution using the same computer system (cross-platform support is not available for this step). The Nastran script will automatically rename jid.marc.tl6 to jid.marc.tl6.1, and the Nastran tl6op2 conversion routines willook for fileswithnames jid.marc.tl6, jid.marc.tl6.1, jid.marc.tl6.2 up to jid.marc.t16.5 in that order. If no such files are found, the tl6op2 job will exit with a message.  

Method to Completely Modify the SOL 6oo Statement:  

For maximum versatility without having to modify the Nastran input file, the SOL 600 statement can be modified completely using the environmental variable SOL600_CMD. Assuming that the original SOL 600 statement in jid.dat contains the string:  

SOL 600,NLSTATIC OUTR $\v{x}=$ OP2,F06 and the environmental variable is set as follows:  

export SOL600_CMD $\mathbf{\Psi}=\mathbf{\dot{\Psi}}$ “SOL 600,NLSTATIC PATH $_{.=1}$ MARCEXE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ SOLVE"  

the new SOL command line internal to Nastran will be  

SOL 600,NLSTATIC PATH $^{-1}$ MARCEXE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ SOLVE and Nastran willstop after creating the Marc input file.This would be the same as if the following SOL600 statement was entered:  

SOL 600,NLSTATIC PATH $^{-1}$ STOP=3  

Any valid SOL 600 statement can be issued using the SOL600_CMD environmental variable without changing the original Nastran input file at all.  

# Remarks:  

1. Only one SOL 6uo,ID job may be run in a directory at any given time. However, it a previous run was made and output files such as name.marc.tl6 were produced, they will be renamed name.marc.tl6.1, etc. following the Nastran re-naming convention.   
2. If OUTR is specified, STOP must not be specified.   
3.The COPYR option can be used to delete allfiles directly created by Marc if the output desired are Nastran files only.   
4.When OUTR is specified, the Marc files such as jid.marc.out, jid.marc.tl6 will be renamed to jid.marc.out.1 and jid.marc.tl6.l at the start of the run. This renaming is accounted for when opening the files   
5. To generate .xdb files, PARAM,POST,0 must be included in the Bulk Data Section. To generate OP2 files with geometry, PARAM,POST,-1 (for Patran and Femap) or PARAM,POST,-2 (for SDRC) should be included in the Bulk Data.   
6. Although SOL 600,ID supports linear analysis $\mathrm{\cdot}\mathrm{\vertD=}101$ , 103, 105), not all features are available. For example, Case Control commands, STATSUB, SUBCOM, SUBSEQ, SYMCOM, AUXMODEL, AXISYMMETRIC, CLOAD,DEFORM, HARMONICS, MFLUID,NSM, and REPCASE are not available. For nonlinear analyses ( $\mathrm{\DeltaID}{=}106$ ,129) Case Control commands, NNLOAD and NONLINEAR are not available.   
7.To output displacements in the jid.marc.out file, do the following: In the Case Control, set DISP(PRINT) $\c=$ ALL or DISP(PRINT,PLOT) $\begin{array}{r}{{\bf\Psi}={\bf\Psi}}\end{array}$ ALL In the Bulk Data, include the following two parameters: PARAM,MARCPRNR,1 PARAM,MARCND99,-1   
8. All SOL 600 character variable parameters, such as MRAFFLOW, must be left justified in the starting in field 3.   
9.If generation options such as EGRID, GRIDG, CGEN,etc.,are used, the MSGMESH option or the environmental variable, S600_MO01 must be set with a value equal to the largest grid ID or element ID (whichever is larger). This is needed for initial SOL 600 memory sizing, which happens before these generation entries are converted to standard Nastran GRID, CQUAD4, etc.entries. SOL 600 can not read the generation features. This environmental variable needs to be included in the script or batch file that runs SOL 600 jobs (for Windows, it can be set in the environment).   
10. Fixed load stepping (or time stepping) is controlled primarily by PARAM,MARCITER and PARAM,MARCAUTO rather than NLPARM or NLAUTO.   
11. 2D and 3D contact and elements may not be mixed in the same model.   
12.For the OUTR options,the only stress tensor available is Cauchy stress (E341).If some other stress tensor is selected using MARCOUT, and E34l is notselected, no stresses will be available in the .op2, .xdb,.pch, or .f06 files.   
13. For multi-layer composites, stresses in the preferred direction (E391),also known as the layer direction, are usually necessary. The default Cauchy stresses (E34l) will be automatically charged tc E391 for composites.   
14. SOL 600 supports a new field on RFORCE (2nd line 4th field) to alow different portions of the structure to have different rotation accelerations.   
15. 2D Plain stress is available and this type of analysis is achieved by setting MID $\mid=$ -1 on all PSHELL entries and adding the following parameters to the bulk data.  

# PARAM,MRALIAS,011003 PARAM,MALIAS02,006003  

SOL 600 will use the alias commands to convert plain strain elements that normally are introduced with $\scriptstyle\mathrm{MID}2=-1$ into the input into plain stress. Although MALIASO2 specifies that Marc element 3 be used for CTRIAi, the new Marc element 201 plain stress triangle willbe used instead of a degenerate element 6 plain stress quad. By default, the CTRIAi node numbers willnot be reversed, however if the user wants to reverse them enter PARAM,MREVPLST,1 in the bulk data.Any contact entered into the file needs to specify 2D on allBCBODY entries. 2D plain stress analysis for SOL 600 is available through Patran which will generate the above alias parameters automatically.  

# Restrictions and Limitations of SOL 600  

Certain features are available in Nastran that are not available in Marc, and vice versa, the following restrictions/limitations are imposed on Nastran. Those restrictions indicated by $(^{*})$ will be removed as soon as possible. Items with $(^{**})$ will issue a FATAL error (for the Nastran-to-Marc translator internal to Nastran) and Marc willnot be“spawned" from Nastran unless NOERROR is entered on the SOL 600 statement.  

External superelements are supported. Other types of superelements are not currently supported. $\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\equiv\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}$ Scalar points are not supported. PBCOMP is not supported. $\mathbf{\delta} $ CCONEAX is not supported. CBARAO is not supported. Output set definitions that contain grid or element numbers greater than the largest grid or elemeni in the model will produce errors in Marc. Output set definitions may include the word BY as in output plot set definitions for use by Marc only. Nastran must be stopped using $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}{=}1 Ḍ$ or one of the OUTR options since BY is a FATAL ERROR to Nastran. Nastran's CREEP entry must be changed to the MATVP entry. For orthotropic materials using MATORT, all shear moduli must be entered. SPOINTs are mapped to GRIDs with x, y, z coordinates at (0., 0., 0.) ■SLOAD and other scalar features are not supported. CELAS3 and CELAS4 are not supported. ■CLOAD is not supported. $\blacktriangledown$ Fracture Mechanics is available. $\blacktriangledown$ Aerodynamics is not supported.  

Bulk data entries with $^+$ or \* in column 73 must have an actual continuation card for most entries. Nastran does not require this, but the internal Marc translator does. $(^{*})$ ·  

Slideline contact is not supported (BLSEG, BWIDTH, BFRIC, BCONP, and BOUTPUT, if entered will cause FATAL ERRORS in Nastran). p-elements are not supported. Offsets are available for CBAR, CBEAM, CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 in all types of structural analysis (linear or nonlinear). The offsets must be specified in the global coordinate system (displacement output coordinate system) unless PARAM,MAROFSET is 1 (2 or 3, see description in Parameter Descriptions, 784).Offsets are available for CQUAD8 and CTRIA6 but only if all 8 or 6 grids are defined for these elements, respectively. If PARAM,MAROFSET,1 (2 or3) is included in the bulk data, the offsets willbe incorporated using a new Marc feature that does not need extra grids or elements.   
For SOL 600, it is required that a Case Control LOAD or DLOAD entry be made for each subcase. If there are no subcases, one LOAD or DLOAD entry must be made.   
For SOL 6O0, it is required that all enforced displacements (other than motion of rigid contact surfaces applied using fields on the BCBODY entry) be applied using SPCD rather than SPC. The ID's of the SPCD must correlate with the Case Control LOAD or DLOAD entries.   
MPCs must be the same for alload cases.   
$\blacktriangledown$ MAT10 is not presently supported.   
The following Solution Sequences are not presently supported: 107, 108, 110, 1l1, 1l4-116, 118, 144-146,190, 200, 400 and 700 and willcause Severe Warnings (FATAL ERRORS) in the internal translator.   
DOMAINSOLVER is not supported. If this Executive Control statement is entered, and Nastran Implicit Nonlinear is requested by the SOL 600, ID statement, the DOMAINSOLVER request will be commented out internally by Nastran.   
IDs Grids, elements, properties, materials, etc. are limited to 9,999,999 unless one of the MRENUxxx items is specified in which case the limit is 10 digits.   
CGAP does not completely map to Marc's gap element. The user should change all Nastran gaps to contact before running SOL 600. If the gaps are not changed to contact, some options willfail to translate as indicated by warning messages. Certain simple gaps translate as expected and will produce nearly the same results as standard Nastran solution sequences, but the user is responsible for ensuring that any model with gaps gives the behavior he expects when using SOL 600.   
Nastran MATS1 Mohr-Coulomb is mapped to Marc's Linear Mohr Coulomb option.   
$\mathbf{\delta}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\left(\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathbf{\overline{{\Pi}}}}\right)$ Nastran MATS1 Drucker-Prager is mapped to Marc's Parabolic Mohr Coulomb option.   
Solid element composite output is not presently available using the OUTR options, It must be postprocessed directly using the tl6 file - Patran is recommended.   
If layered output for Composite Structures is desired, the following bulk data parameters or bulk data entry, MARCOUT with LAYCODE of 1 or 2 should be included in the Bulk Data. If output for all layers is desired, set LAYCODE to zero and enter the following parameters: param,mroutlay,N  

param,marcslht,N  

where $\Nu$ is the maximum number of layers in any composite PCOMP description. The preferred option is MARCOUT with LAYCODE $_{,=1}$  

The rotational acceleration portion of RFORCE (RACC) is not supported and if entered will generate a Severe Warning and Marc will not be spawned.  

The following Case Control option for displacement/velocity/acceleration/spcforce/ mpcforce are not supported and will be ignored if entered: SORT2, REAL, IMAG, PHASE, PSDF,ATOC, CRMS, RALL, RPRINT, RPUNCH, NORPRINT, CID, TM, RM   
Elements with mid-side nodes must have all mid-side nodes. For example CTETRA must either have 4 or 10 nodes.   
For PC systems, if SOL 600 is run from a command prompt (DOS box), if any old DOS programs are used prior to running SOL 60O the path where the job is being run is usually adjusted such that any names longer than 8 characters willbe shortened (for example brake-squeal becomes BRAKE${\it-3}$ ). The continue options including brake squeal jobs will not work when this happens. Open a new command prompt and run SOL 600 before any old DOS programs are run in that window.   
The CID field on the RFORCE entry is not completely supported. If entered with a positive integer, the job will abort with a Severe Warning unless PARAM,MARCRCID is entered. PARAM,MARCRCID,1 may be used to ignore this field in which case R1,R2,R3 define the direction cosines of the rotation vector (see Marc Volume C, ROTATION A description) and the magnitude is given by. $\mathtt{A^{*}s q r t(R1^{**}2}\mathtt{+R2^{**}2}\mathtt{+R3^{**}2})$ [see RFORCE description for definitions of CID,A, R1, R2, R3 as well as Remark 16].   
■Filenames entered on SOL 600 Bulk Data entries must be entered in small field fixed format, must be left-justified in the first applicable field and must be entered in lower case unless otherwise noted.   
$\left|\begin{array}{l l}{\mathbf{\overline{{u}}}}\end{array}\right.$ For any jobs using the CONTINUE option or brake squeal, the jid must be entirely in lower case for Linux systems.   
$\blacktriangledown$ Ixy of PBAR/PBEAM is ignored, if entered, for SOL 600.   
■PARAM,MRDISCMB $^{-1}$ must be used for models with multiple subcases with the same pressure loadings in each subcase. The program will automatically attempt to reset the default (mrdiscmb $_{\cdot=0}$ to mrdiscmb $_{\cdot=1}$ in such circumstances, however, it is recommended that the user does this himself.   
Some Bulk Data input entries are not checked as completely for SOL 60O as they are for other solution sequences, particularly those that apply only to SOL 600.In addition,certain checks for all types of entries, even those that can be used in other solution sequences may be made after Marc is spawned or the error messages not output until after Marc is spawned. For those cases, the error message, if any, will not be visible until Marc has finished and may not even be output unless one or more of the OUTR options is selected. Users should take special care that the SOL 600 input is free from errors and that no duplicates occur prior to running SOL 600. One way to do this which is highly recommended is to run a preliminary SOL 101 job with as much of the same input file as possible.   
■For SOL 600, it is required that all enforced displacements (other than motion of rigid contact  

surfaces described by fields in BCBODY entries) be applied using SPCD rather than SPC. The ID's of the SPCD must correlate with the Case Control LOAD or DLOAD entries.  

If an .op2, .xdb,.f06, and/or punch file is requested using the OUTR option, static analyses must have“times" ranging from 0.0-1.0 for the first subcase, 1.0-2.0 for the second subcase, etc. If NLAUTO is used to change these times, the job willfail with an appropriate message. This means that if NLAUTO is used TFINAL (field 4) must always be 1.0.   
■Concentrated masses are not considered in gravity loading for linear or nonlinear static analyses.   
Non-structural mass is ignored by SOL 600.

# Summary:  

SOL 700 is an Executive Control statement like SOL that activates an explicit nonlinear transient analysis integration scheme.The calculations willnot be performed directly within MSC Nastran. Instead, SOL 700 will use a separate solver spawned from MSC Nastran.This client-server approach is similar to SOL 600, using Marc.  

The SOL 700 statement willspawn an executable which is a 3D, explicit nonlinear analyses code DMP (distributed memory parallel processing domain decomposition) capabilities.  

For $\mathrm{ID}{=}129$ or NLTRAN, SOL 700 will generate an intermediate input data file, jid.dytr.dat, where “jid" is the name of the MSC Nastran input file without the extension).For example,if the MSC Nastran input file is named abcd.dat, (or abcd.bdf) then “jid' $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ abcd).  

Unless specified differently using the $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TOP}_{ Ḋ }=3 Ḍ Ḍ$ option, the executable will be executed from MSC Nastran on any computer system capable of doing so (which includes most Linux systems and Windows systems).For it to run,it must be installed, properly licensed, and accessible from the directory where the MSC Nastran input data resides, MSC_BASE must be provided in the environment.  

# Nastran SOL 700 Update:  

Starting in MSC Nastran 2019.0 there is a change in the execution of MSC Nastran SOL 700.SOL 700 with LS-Dyna is no longer supported by MSC Nastran. Instead, a new explicit solver is introduced in MSC Nastran 2019.0. This version can be activated by adding VERSION $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ PRIMARY to SOL 700 in the input file or simply by leaving it blank as this willbe the default.A new license featurewillbe needed to run this new version: NA_Explicit_Dytran.  

The new SOL 700 will support both DMP and SMP paralelization. For this, the solver will pull licenses from the following license feature: NA_Parallel.  

Customers that have a lease agreement willno longerbe able to run MSC Nastran SOL 700 jobs from version of MSC Nastran before 2018.0.The binaries needed were in the prior version located in msc20200/dytran directory of the MSC Nastran installation. However, this directory will be missing after the installation of MSC Nastran 2019.0.  

Paid-up customers of MSC Nastran before 2018.0 can continue to use MSC Nastran SOL 700 jobs from version of MSC Nastran before 2018.0.For those customers, there willbe no change in the FlexLM License features.  

Executive Control Parameters:  

The required ID may beone of several valid solution sequence integers or names shown in Table 2for the SOL statement. Examples are 129 and NLTRAN.  

The following solutions are available: 101, 106, 109, 129 (and their equivalent names).  

Allitems on the SOL 700,ID after ID itself may be specified by environmental variables.This may be done any way environmental variables can be set.They may be set by the MSC Nastran user at run time or by the system administrator when MSC Nastran is installed.Any values specified on the SOL statement override those in the environment.Environmental variables are fully described in the MSC Nastran 2020 Installation and Operations Guide.A keywords file is available to describethe format of each variable.The variable is normally set in the system-wide rc file, a user's rc file, alocal rc file or in a script used to submit MSC Nastran.  

[he following describes the various options for PATH. We suggest that PATH $\scriptstyle\cdot=3$ for all computer systems  

# PATH $\lvert=1$ (Windows Only)  

If $\mathbf{PATH{=}1}$ is specified, MSC Nastran will determine the proper command to execute a serial run. To aid MSC Nastran in determining where Dytran is located, the dynrun.pth file must be located in the same directory where the MSC Nastran input file resides.The dynrun.pth file must contain one line providing the location (complete path) of the SOL 700 run script. A typical example of the line in the file dynrun.pth follows.  

Windows c:\sol700\  

A string is appended to this path to form the complete command used to execute the SOL 700 executable. "dytran jid $\v{x}=$ name.dytr.dat"  

For Windows, MSC Nastran willspawn the external executable using the following command assuming the MSC Nastran input data is named enf2e.dat. (Although the example appearslike it is on multiplelines,it is actually on a single line.)  

c:\sol700/dytran jid $\c=$ enf2e.dytr.dat  

# PATH $\scriptstyle\left|=3\right.$ (AIl Systems)  

IfPATH $\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}=3$ is specified, a script or batch file located in the same directory as the SOL 700 executable will be executed.The name of the executable is dytran (linux)or dytran.exe (Windows).This directory and name of the script is determined by thefirst line in a file named sol700.pth which must be in the same directory as the Nastran input file. Options are specified on subsequent lines of the sol700.pth file.For example, if Nastran is installed in C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\2020,the dytran.exelocationis C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\2020\msc20200 /dytran\win64\bin\dytran. To use sol700.pth file, the first line must be C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\2020\msc20200\dytran\win64\bin\dytran.  

Available PATH=3 options for Windows PC systems are as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>exe=</td><td>The full path to the executable that is to be used. Optional -- If exe= is omitted, the directory where the script or batch file resides (first line of</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"> nproc</td><td> sol700.pth) willbe used and dytran for Linux and dytran.exe for windows will be appended. If</td></tr><tr><td>exe= is used, it must be the second line in the sol700.pth file. Number of processors. (only for DMP run)</td></tr><tr><td>(Default is to used NP on the SOL 7O0 line. If NP and nproc are omitted, the default is 1).For parallel execution, the directory where the MSC Nastran input file exists must be shared with read/write privileges. If wdir is used, it must also be shared (see below). The directory where</td></tr><tr><td>ncpus</td><td>the Dytran executable resides must also be shared for parallel execution. Number of processors. (only for SMP) (Default is not used.) If ncpus is greater than 1 in sol700.pth, Nastran SOL 700 automatically</td></tr><tr><td>bat</td><td>uses SMP capability. Run in background or foreground (Default).</td></tr><tr><td>hlist</td><td>Host file name. Name of a hostfile containing the same information as “machine” The format of hostfile is as follows for the example for machine: machine1 2</td></tr><tr><td>intelmpi</td><td>machine1 4 To activate the Intel MPI set intelmpi equal to yes. Default is no. If intelmpi=yes is placed</td></tr><tr><td>atb</td><td>directly on the command line (not in sol700.pth) Intel MPI will be activated too.</td></tr><tr><td>imm</td><td>the name of atb file. the name of imm file.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

A Windows example of the file sol700.pth for the PATH $\scriptstyle\cdot=3$ case follows.  

C:\MSC.Software\MsC_Nastran\2020\msc20200\dytran\win64\bin\dytran nastran nproc $=4$  

For the above example, MSC Nastran willcreate the following command to spawn the SOL 700 executable assuming your input file is named abcd.dat.(Although the example appears like it is on multiple lines, it is actually on a single line.)  

C:\Program Files\MSC.Software\MSC_Nastran\2020\msc20200\dytran\win64\bin\dytran nastran nproc $=6$  

AvailablePATH $\scriptstyle1=3$ options for Linux systems follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>debug</td><td>Specifying debug=yes indicates if you want to keep scratch files and other debug information to investigate when a job fails to run. Default is no.</td></tr><tr><td>exe</td><td>The full path to the executable for Dytran that is to be used. (Optional)</td></tr><tr><td>fsidmp</td><td>Specifying fsidmp=yes indicates to run the FSI Distributed Memory Parallel version. Default is no. If FSIDMP=YES is placed directly on the command line (not in sol700.pth) FSI Distributed Memory Parallel will be activated too.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>hlist</td><td>The (local) filename containing the hosts list. If this file is not given or not found, a default local hosts list is used. Note that the MPI universe in which the selected nodes and CPUs</td></tr><tr><td>nproc</td><td>reside is expected to exist and be accessible (i.e., be booted). Number of processors. (only for DMP run)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(Default is to use NP on the SOL 700 line. If NP and nproc are omitted, the default is 1.) NOTE: The number of requested processes must be a power of 2.</td></tr><tr><td>ncpus</td><td>Number of processors. (only for SMP)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(Default is not used.) If ncpus is greater than 1 in sol700.pth, Nastran SOL 700</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>automatically uses SMP capability.</td></tr><tr><td>atb imm</td><td>the name of atb file. the name of imm file.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

A Linux example of the file sol700.pth for the PATH $\scriptstyle\cdot=3$ case is as follows:  

/app/msc/msc20200/dytran/linux64/bin/dytran nastran nproc $:=4$ For the above example, MSC Nastran willcreate the a command similar to the following to spawn the SOL 700 executable assuming your input file is named abcd.dat  

/app/msc/msc20200/dytran/linux64/bin/dytran nastran nproc=4  

If PATH is not specified, the default search path willbe used to locate the dytran executable.This version will be located in a subdirectory named dytran/machine below the MSC Nastran base directory (MSC_BASE). Not all PATH $\scriptstyle\cdot=3$ options are available using this default path option.  

STOP  

STOP is an optional item. STOP is used to prevent execution of Dytran or prevent execution of MSC Nastran after IFP if so desired. The various options are as follows:  

$\mathsf{S T O P=}1$  

If STOP=1 MSC Nastran will gracefully stop after IFP. This option is used to prevent MSC Nastran fron performing its own solution (normally used when the solution is performed with $\mathrm{ID}{=}129$ ）  

$\mathsf{S T O P}{=}3$  

STOP=3 MSC Nastran is stopped after IFP and Dytran is not executed.This would be the normal STOP option if the user wants to examine the intermediate input file, make some changes and then execute Dytran manually.  

The following files are potentially affected by the COPYR option:  

NP(or DMP700) $\mid=$ the Number of Processors  

NP(or DMP7o0)=the number of processors (domains) for parallel processing.The default is one. In order to use more than one domain, MPI, Lam, POE, or whatever parallel program is needed must be properly installed onallcomputers involved anda hostfiledesignating which computers are to be used foreach domain must have been setup prior to running the job. If $\mathrm{NP{>}1}$ ,PATH $\scriptstyle\cdot=3$ is used and a file named sol700.pth is located in the same directory as the MSC Nastran input data. The sol700.pth file should contain all commands necessary to run in parallel. This file must have execute permissions.

Remarks:  

1. All of the keywords for the target application must be enclosed in parentheses.  

2. The following table correlates target applications with available factorization methods.

3. More than one SPARSESOLVER entry may be used, so that one may specify diffrent options for different target modules.  

4. System cell 206 can specify both a reordering method and a compression method by adding the respective values.For example, to specify GRDSUPER compression method with BEND reordering, SYSTEM(206) would be set to 68 (since $64+4=68$ ). Or, to specify SUPER compression with METIS reordering, SYSTEM(206) would be set to 136 (since $128\substack{+8=136}$ ：   
5. Note that SYSTEM(166), SYSTEM(206) and SYSTEM(209) have precedence over the SPARSESOLVER command, whether set on the submittal line or in DMAP.   
6. System cell 166 can also be used to turn on extra diagnostic output from the sparse factorization by setting SYSTEM(166)=2.   
7. The choices for ordering method are: AMF, BEND, MD, METIS,MMD, PRDMD, PRDMETIS, PRDSMPMS, and NONE. The default automatically selects among METIS, MMD and BEND.   
8. The UMFLU factorization method ignores COMPMETH and ORDMETH since it contains its own compression/reordering method.   
9. The matrix diagonal term ratio (MDTRATIO) and value (MDTSTATS) keywords and options are used only by the DCMP target application. They will be ignored by other target applications.   
10. The MDTRATIO and MDTSTATS keywords apply to both translational and rotational degrees of freedom unless modified by the T or R describer. Separate output is produced for each of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom in the matrix.   
11. The MDTRATIO and MDTSTATS CHART option default produces a chart of values contained in powers of ten bandwidths. A specification for the nsegs describer causes the bandwidth to be internally computed to produce nsegs bars. Bars are produced for the bandwidths only if they contain terms.   
12. MDTRATIO and MDTSTATS keywords are processed in the order given. It is possible for a keyword to modify the effects of a previously processed keyword. For example, the combination CHART, CHARTR ${.=}5$ produces different outputs compared to CHARTR $_{.=5}$ , CHART.  

13. The MDTRATIO NMAXRAT describer limits the content of the TABLE output to the specified highest number of diagonal ratios that exceed the value of the MAXRAT describer.  

14.MDTSTATS generates output for matrix diagonal term values.For the TABLE option, it produces a table containing the NMINVAL $\v{r}=\v{r}$ nmin smallest terms smaller than MINVAL $\v{x}_{1}=$ vmin as well as the NMAXVAL $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ nmax largest terms larger than MAXVAL $\v=$ vmax.   
15. The ORDMETH option must be one of PRDMD, PRDMETIS, or PRDSMPMS for PRDLDL and PRDLU.   
16. The COMPMETH option is ignored for PRDLDL and PRDLU.   
17． The DOMAINSOLVER (RUNOPT $\dot{\bf{\theta}}={\bf{\theta}}$ MULTIMST) option is not supported with PRDLDL or PRDLU.   
18. For PRDLDL and PRDLU, if there is not sufficient memory for an in-core solver, then an out-ofcore solver will be attempted and performance will be negatively affected.  

19. The following special rules apply for PRDLDL for NLSOLV:  

a. The maximum number of threads used is given by $\mathrm{DMP^{*}S M P}$ ， and PRDLDL will choose a number of threads, up to this maximum, most suitable to the problem size.   
b. PRDLDL is supported only when FNT or PFNT method is used for nonlinear iteration (KMETHOD of NLPARM or NLSTEP).   
c. If the problem fails to converge with PRDLDL, then add MDLPRM,LMT2MPC,1 to the bu. data section in order to convert Lagrange multipliers to MPCs.  

20. The following special rules apply for PRDLDL for DCMP:  

a. DMP is not supported for PRDLDL for DCMP as it only gets parallelism from SMP   
b. PRDLDL automatically provides parallelization over multiple RHSs with SMP.   
c. If PRDLDL encounters a zero pivot issue (SFM 1l332),the user should rerun with bulk data entry MDLPRM,PRDMTYPE,-2 to have Intel MKL Pardiso regard the matrix as indefinite, and entry MDLPRM,PRDWMTCH,0 in order to turn off weighted matching. Problems involving linear contact (BCONTACT) are particularly liable to creating indefinite systems. Turning off weighted matching will speed time to solution.  

21. The following special rules apply for PRDLU for CEAD:  

a. PRDLU is only supported for the CLAN option within CEAD (refer to CMETHOD option).  

22. The following special rules apply for PRDLU for FRRD1:  

a. The Krylov solver is not supported with PRDLU for FRRD1.   
b. DMP is supported for PRDLU for FRRD1.   
c. MKL Pardiso is not supported in the uncoupled solution algorithm for FRRD1.  

23.For CEAD,the default solver for unsymmetric matrices is UMFPACK while for Hermitian matrice the default is MSCLU.  

24. User specified factorization method (fmeth) via SPARSESOLVER entry or SYSTEM(209) may be overwritten automatically due to matrix type or symmetry by MSC Nastran.  

25.Several options for Intel MKL Pardiso are controlled using the MDLPRM bulk data entry.See the PRD\* parameters detailed in the MDLPRM section.  

Sets the maximum CPU and I/O time.  

Format: TIME[=]t1[,t2]  

Examples:  

1. The following example designates a runtime of 8 hours: TIME 480 2. The following example designates 90 seconds:  

TIME1.5

# Case Control Commands  

# Comment  

Used to insert comments into the input file. Comment statements may appear anywhere within the input file.  

For SOL 700 only, the string $\ensuremath{\$}5700^{\ensuremath{?}}$ (starting in column 1 with a blank in column 6) may be used to transfer any Case Control string directly to Dytran. For example:  

$\$5700$ ELOUT(TEST1) $\c=$ XVEL,YVEL,ZVEL,DENSITY,SIE,PRESSURE,fmat will become  

ELOUT(TEST1) $\c=$ XVEL,YVEL,ZVEL,DENSITY,SIE,PRESSURE,fmat in the Case Control Section of the Dytran input (jid.dytr.dat) file. Please see descriptions of $\ensuremath{\mathrm{~\boldmath~\$~}}\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\$}}\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{S}}7\ensuremath{00}^{\ensuremath{\prime}}$ Case Control entries elsewhere in this section.  

Format: $\$8$ followed by any characters out to column 80.  

Example:  

$\$5$ TEST FIXTURE-THIRD MODE  

Remarks:  

1. Comments are ignored by the program.   
2. Comments will appear only in the unsorted echo of the Bulk Data.  

All entries which start with $\$5700$ in the Case Control Section will be passed directly to the SOL 700 solver. Import of Euler results and the control of output generation are using this entry:  

# Output Control:  

No need to use the Nastran classical case control output (STRESS,DISP,...). This option controls ARC (state file) and THS (time history file) output files.  

You need to specify the following for a complete output specification:  

1. Type of the file   
2.What entities (e.g., grid points, elements, rigid bodies, etc.)   
3. What results are output   
4. How often it is saved   
5. How often data is written

Remarks:  

1. Default of ARC output control is set to the ARC file generation of all Eulerian elements with all available variables.   
2. Continuation lines are supported for SET,ELOUT, TIMES and STEPS. The continuation lines must start with at least two spaces after the $\$5700$ string. A comma (,) at the end of a line signifie: that the next line is a continuation.   
3. Either STEPS or TIMES must be specified. STEPS and TIMES can not be used for the same logical_file.   
4. A list of times or steps should be in ascending order.   
5. Check Chapter 11: Outputing Results in MSC Nastran SOL70 User's Guide. It includes all Entity types Entity variables and Variable names.  

Import Euler results:  

Specifies an Euler archive that was created during a previous simulation and is used as input for a transient analysis.The Euler archive is mapped onto a setof Euler elements that can equal in size or either finer or coarser.  

# Format:  

$\$5700$ EULINIT， filename,CYCLE,MESH-ID  

# Example:  

$\$5700$ EULINIT,AXISYM ALLEULER O.ARC,60  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>filename</td><td>The filename of the ARC file to be used.</td></tr><tr><td>CYCLE</td><td>Cycle number.</td></tr><tr><td>MESH-ID</td><td>The MESH ID of the target elements.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

iemarks: 1. The target elements are the elements defined in the folow-up run and are the elements that will be initialized using the import archive. 2. Both defined and imported Euler elements need to be orthogonal in the global system. 3. MESH-ID enables support for multiple Euler domains. If MESH-ID is not set the import archive will be mapped onto all Euler elements. 4.For multi-material Euler analyses with multiple Eulerian materials all material variables in the import archive require the material number. These material variables are MASS, DENSITY, SIE, FMAT. The required list of variables for a MMHYDRO run are: MASSXX, SIEXX, FMATXX, XVEL, YVEL, ZVEL. Here XX denotes the material number.FOR MMSTREN the variables TXX, TYY, TZZ, TXY, TYZ, TZX, EFFPLS have to be added. Ifthe multi-material run uses only one Eulerian material then the material numbers can be left out. 5.For multi-material Euler analyses with EOSlG, the following has to be added for the IG materials: MASS-EXX, MASS-PXX, RHO-EXX, RHO-PXX, IGBURNXX, FMAT-PXX, FMAT-PXX, SIEEXX, and SIE-PXX. Here XX denotes the material number 6. For the single-material Hydro Euler solver the required list is MASS, DENSITY,SIE, FMAT, and FVUNC. 7.IF FVUNC is not included in the Import archive it is assumed that all elements in this archive are fully uncovered. It is allowed to import such an archive in a simulation with a coupling surface. In this follow up simulation the target elements can have uncover fractions diferent from one. In this case conservative quantities of imported elements are reduced by the uncover fraction of the target element. This is to avoid unwanted pressure increases. It simply means that any mass of the import archive that is located in the covered part of the target elements is thrown away. As a result not all mass in the import archive is mapped to the target elements. How much of the mass of the import archive is mapped is shown in the out file. 8.In the OUT file, a summary is shown of all variables that are mapped. 9.In the follow-up run, the cycle and time are taken from the import archive.The results of the first cycle of the folow-up run are determined from remapping onlyand has not gone through an equation of state yet. This will happen in the next cycle 10.If needed the remapping can be checked by doing onlyone additionalcycle in the follow-up run with a quite smalltime step. Then, the follow-up OUT file shows two cycles and the results should be almost identical to the results of the import archive. Also, material summaries in the OUT file between first run and follow-up run should be identical. The only exceptions are the summaries of momentum, kinetic energy, and total energy per material. For these three quantities, only the total amounts will remain constant between first and follow-up run.  

11. To remap a spherical symmetric or an axial symmetric Euler archive, the DYPARAMs DYPARAM,SPREMAP and DYPARAM,AXREMAP have to be used. Also, the remapping of a spherical symmetric Euler domain onto a 2-D axial symmetric Euler domain is supported.  

Selects a direct input fluid-structure coupling matrix.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>name</td><td> Name of a fluid-structure coupling matrix that is input on the DMIG Bulk Data entry.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. DMIG entries will not be used unless selected by the A2GG Case Control command.   
2. This entry must be above subcase level or in the first subcase.   
3.If the A2GG Case Control command selects a DMIG entry, then Nastran willadd the selected fluidstructure coupling matrix to the computed coupling matrix. To replace the computed coupling matrix with the selected A2GG matrix, set PARAM,ASCOUP,NO. The user may still define panels with the panel selection procedure.   
4.When filling out the DMIG entries: $\mathrm{IFO}=1$ 。 ${\mathrm{NCOL}}={\mathrm{g}}$ -size, GJ-column index corresponds to fluid points, $\mathrm{CJ}=0$ , Gi-row index corresponds to structural points, Ci-corresponds to DOF, Ai-the area values.   
5. A2GG is supported in dynamic solutions with fluid-structure coupling.   
6. Only one A2GG command should be used.It must appear above any subcase structure or in the first subcase only.

Remarks:  

1. Acceleration output is only available for transient and frequency response problems.Acceleration is only available for transient and frequency response problems and when response spectra is requested in eigenvalue analysis.   
2. See Remark 1 under DISPLACEMENT (Case), 298 for a discussion of SORT1 and SORT2.   
3． ACCELERATION $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ NONE allows overriding an overall output request.   
4.Acceleration results are output in the global coordinate system (seefield CD on the GRID Bulk Data entry).   
5. The option of PSDF, ATOC, CRMS, and RALL, or any combination of them, can be selected for random analysis. Here PSDF, ATOC and CRMS output is always in SORT2 format.   
6. Note that the CID keyword affects only grid point related output, such as displacement (DISP), velocity (VELO), acceleration (ACCEL), OLOAD, SPCforce (SPCF),and MPCforce (MPCF). In addition, the CID keyword needs to appear only once in a grid-related output request anywhere in the Case Control Section to turn on the printing algorithm.

1. ADACT is processed only when an adaptive analysis is requested. An ADAPT Case Control command must be present in order to have an p-adaptive analysis.   
2. In a static analysis, $\mathrm{\ADACT=n}$ is equivalent to ADACT $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ ALL, and ALL means that the results of all subcases will be included in the error analysis. When ADACT $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ NONE in any subcase, the results of that subcase are excluded from the error analysis and adaptivity.   
3.In an eigenvalue analysis, ALL means that the results of allthe modes willbe included in the error analysis.   
4. Only one ADACT command may be specified per subcase.

Remarks:  

1. This entry represents a collection of PARAM,name,value entries. A license is required for the Nastran/ADAMS interface.   
2. ADAMSMNF FLEXBODY $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ YES is required to execute the Nastran/ADAMS interface, all other ADAMSMNF items are optional. The ADAMSMNF FLEXBODY $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ YES must occur above subcase level. If you want standard Nastran data recovery in addition to that produced for ADAMS, you need to run with FLEXONLY $\dot{\bf{\theta}}={\bf{\theta}}$ NO. The orthonormal modes produced for ADAMS and the modes produced by the standard MSC Nastran run may be viewed in Patran if run with PARAM,POST,0.  

3. The nine mass invariants are defined by Eqs. (5-1) through (5-9):  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{1}}\\ {{1\nonumber\phantom{\left|\begin{array}{c}{{1}}\\ {{1\times1}}\end{array}\right|}=\displaystyle\sum_{p\ =\ 1}^{N}m_{p}}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\displaystyle{\mathit{\Omega}}^{2}{}_{I}}}\\ {{3\times1}}\end{array}=\sum_{p\ =\ 1}^{N}m_{p}{s}_{p}
$$  

$$

$$  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\displaystyle{4_{I}}}}\\ {{\displaystyle{3\times M}}}\end{array}=\sum_{p\ =\ 1}^{N}{m_{p}\tilde{s}_{p\Phi_{p}}}+{I_{p}\Phi_{p}^{*}}
$$  

$$

where $s_{p}=\left[x y z\right]^{T}$ are the coordinates of grid point $\boldsymbol{p}$ in the basic coordinate system;  

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{\boldsymbol{s}}}_{p}~=~\left[\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{-z}&{y}\\ {z}&{0}&{-x}\\ {-y}&{x}&{0}\end{array}\right]
$$  

is the skew-symmetric vector cross product operator; $\Phi_{p}$ is the partitioned orthogonal modal matrix that corresponds to the translational degrees-of-freedom of grid p; $I_{p}$ is the inertia tensor; $\Phi_{p}^{*}$ is the partitioned orthogonal modal matrix that corresponds to the rotational degrees-of-freedom of grid $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{P}}$ $\tilde{\Phi}_{p f}$ is the skew-symmetric matrix formed for each grid translational degree-of-freedom for each mode; M is the number of modes; and $\Nu$ is the number of grid points.  

4. The preceding massinvariant calculation currently depends on a lumped massformulation. The parameter PARAM,COUPMASS should not be specified when executing the Nastran/ADAMS interface. Since p-elements use a coupled mass formulation, they should not be used.  

5. If the CONM1 is used, M21, M3l, and M32 entries should be left blank.  

6. If PARAM,GRDPNT,value specified, mas invariants $^{1}I,{^2I}$ , and $^7I$ will be obtained from an Nastran grid point weight generator execution in the basic system.  

7. The following DTI,UNITS Bulk Data entry is required for a FLEXBODY $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ YES run:  

Since ADAMS is not a unitless code (as is Nastran), units must be specified. A DTI Bulk Data entry provides‘UNITS' (a unique identifier) input as the following example illustrates.Once identified, the units will apply to all superelements in the model. Acceptable character input strings are listed in the following table.  

Format:  

DTI UNITS 1 MASS FORCE LENGTH TIME  

Example:  

DTI UNITS 1 KG N M  

# Mass:  

kg - kilogram   
lbm - pound-mass   
slug - slug   
gram - gram   
ozm - ounce-mass   
klbm - kilo pound-mass (1000.lbm)   
mgg - megagram   
slinch - 12 slugs   
ug - microgram   
ng - nanogram   
uston - US ton  

Force:  

n - newton   
lbf - pounds-force   
kgf - kilograms-force   
ozf - ounce-force   
dyne - dyne   
kn - kilonewton   
klbf - kilo pound-force (1000.lbf)   
mn - millinewton   
un - micronewton   
nn - nanonewton  

Length:  

km - kilometer m - meter   
cm - centimeter mm - millimeter mi - mile   
ft - foot   
in - inch   
um- micrometer nm - nanometer ang - angstrom yd - yard   
mil - milli-inch uin - micro-inch  

# Time:  

h- hour   
min - minute   
s- sec   
ms - millisecond   
us - microsecond   
nanosec - nanosecond   
d - day  

A note of clarification about UNITS and its relation to Nastran's WTMASS parameter: WTMASS, though necessary to achieve units consistency in Nastran, is ignored in the output for ADAMS. Units data for ADAMS is supplied on the UNITS DTI entry. For example, consider a model with mass in grams,force in Newtons, length in meters, and time in seconds. A WTMASS parameter equal to 0.001 would ensure that Nastran works with a consistent set of units $(\mathrm{kg},\mathrm{N},$ and m). The units reported to ADAMS should then be: “DTI, UNITS, 1, GRAM, N, M, S."  

8. OUTSTRS or OUTSTRN entries require the use of the standard Nastran STRESS $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ or STRAIN $\dot{\bf\Phi}={\bf\Phi}$ Case Control commands to produce element stress or strain. STRESS(PLOT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ or STRAIN(PLOT) $\mid=$ will suppresstress or strain output to the Nastran .fO6 file. The OUTSTRS or OUTSTRN entries are required for importing ADAMS results into MSC Fatigue. See the Nastran/ADAMS/durability documentation for more information.  

9. OUTGSTRS or OUTGSTRN entries require the use of the standard Nastran $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TRESSḌ}=$ or STRAIN $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ Case Control commands used in conjunction with GPSTRESS= or GPSTRAIN $\c=$ Case Control commands to produce grid point stress or strain. GPSTRESS(PLOT) $\mid=$ or GPSTRAIN(PLOT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ will suppress grid stress or strain output to the Nastran .f06 file.  

10. To reduce the finite element mesh detail for dynamic simulations, PSETID $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ set_entry is used to define a set of PLOTELs or other elements used to display the component in ADAMS. If a mass invariant computation is requested, this option can significantly reduce the size of the .mnf without compromising accuracy in the ADAMS simulation.  

If PSETID specifies an existing set from the OUTPUT(PLOT) Section of Nastran, this single set is used explicitly to define elements to display in ADAMS. Otherwise, the Nastran Case Control Section willbe searched for a matching set ID. This matching set ID list then represents a list of OUTPUT(PLOT) defined elements sets, the union of which willbe used to define a set of PLOTELS or other elements used to display the component in ADAMS.If the user wishes to select all of the sets in the OUTPUT(PLOT) Section, then use PSETID $\sqsupseteq$ ALL.  

The elements defined may include rigid element IDs. When defining these sets, do not use EXCLUDE and EXCEPT descriptions.  

If a superelement analysis is being executed, any element defined on the PSETID $\mid=$ set_entry that lies entirely on the superelement boundary (i.e.,allof its grids are a-set or exterior to the superelement) must also be specified on a SEELT Bulk Data entry. The SEELT entry would not be required for part superelements, as boundary elements stay with their component.  

OUTPUT(PLOT) SET $7722\ =\ 10001$ THRU 10010  

11. The ADMOUT=YES option is intended for users who plan to import ADAMS results into MSC Fatigue. This option requires the following assignment command in the File Management Section of the Nastran file:  

ASSIGN OUTPUT2 $\scriptstyle=^{\prime}$ name.out'STATUS $\c=$ UNKNOWN UNIT $\scriptstyle\sum0$ FORM $\varXi$ UNFORM  

It causes .op2 files with an .out extension to be generated for input into MSC Fatigue. FLEXBODY $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ YES is required with its use. The files' outputs are: DTI-units, SE-number of superelements (9999 if residual), SEIDX-superelement id, ASETX-size of a-set, BGPDTS-grid location table, GEOM2S-element connections, GEOM4S-constraints and sets,MGGEW-physical mass external sort with weight mass removed, VAEXT-a-set partition vector, VGEXT- $\mathrm{\Phi^{\cdot}g}$ -set partition vector, VAPEXT-eigenvalue size partition vector, MAAEW-modal mass, KAAE-modal stiffness, BAAE-modal damping, RAE-modal preload, PAE-modal loads, CMODEXT-component modes, OES1-element stress shapes, OSTRl-element strain shapes, OGS1-grid point stress shapes, OGSTR1-grid point strain shapes, OGSIPL-grid point physical preload stress, OGTRIPL-grid point physical preload strain. The files are output for each superelement and their generation depends on the loading and output requests.  

To ensure compatibility with the ADAMS .op2-to-.mnf translator, if the ADAMSMNF Case Control command has the keyword ADMOUT $\dot{\bf\Phi}=\bf\Phi $ YES, the Nastran SYSTEM word OP2NEW is automatically set to OP2NEW $\scriptstyle\sum($ . This means that any .op2 files generated will have a pre-MSC Nastran 2004 format.  

12.Environment variables controlling .mnf generation can be set before submiting the Nastran job,or by using the Nastran keyword ‘MNFWRITEOPTIONS' which can be abbreviated to any short unique string such as ‘MNFW'. The Nastran keyword can be entered on the NASTRAN submittal command line or in a user .nastran rc file. For example, interior grids and elements can be removed in the .mnf by entering, prior to the Nastran submittal, with Korn shell:  

expOrt MDI_MNFWRITE_OPTIONS $\c=$ strip_face with C shell:  

seteNV MDI MNFWRITE OPTIONS $\c=$ strip face  

Or, at the time of Nastran submittal:  

nastran submittal command jid MNFW $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ strip face  

Consult the ADAMS/Flex documentation for more information on the use of environment variables during .mnf generation.  

The command  

nastran submittal command help mnfw will generate the description of the symbol keyword. The command  

nastran submittal command help all will generate a complete set of Nastran submittal keywords.  

13..mnf naming convention is as follows: for a single superelement run, jid.mnf ; fora residual onlyor multiple superelement run jid_seid.mnf, etc.; where seidl and seid2 are the integer numbers of the superelement. The default location of these files is the same directory as the jid.fO6 file. See the ASSIGN .mnf command to change directory location.  

14. When supplying SPOINT/QSET combinations, there should be a sufficient number of combinations to correctly capture the modal shapes. If $n$ is the number of modes specified on the EIGR or EIGRL Bulk Data entries and $\boldsymbol{p}$ is the number of loadcases specified, then the number of SPOINTs(ns) should be at least $n s~=~n+(6+p)$ assuming that residual flexibility is on.In general, there cannot be too many SPOINTS, as excess ones will simply be truncated with no performance penalty.  

15. The user can have Nastran automatically specify the SPOINT/QSET by including, above the Case Control Section the parameter PARAM,AUTOQSET,YES. In this case no SPOINT/QSET can appear in the Bulk Data. See the PARAM,AUTOQSET description for detailed requirements or limitations.  

16. By default, MSC Nastran 2005 will create a version $6.0\mathrm{MNF}$ . ADAMS 2005 is able to read the version 6.0 .mnf file. Earlier ADAMS versions are not able to read a 6.0 .mnf file. Nastran can be instructed to write a backward-compatible .mnf file by submitting the Nastran job with MNFWRITEOPTIONS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ full_str. Alternatively, the user may set the environment variable MDI_MNFWRITE_OPTIONS to full_str'. See Remark 12.for more information on controlling the .mnf format.  

17. In addition to modal stiffnessand modal mass matrices, the modal damping matrix may also be output to the .mnf. The damping allowed is the standard Nastran damping matrix consisting of $[B_{g g}]$ viscous damping, $(1/w4)$ $[K4_{g g}]$ structural damping, $(g/(w3)+\mathbf{a}2)[K_{g g}]$ structural and Rayleigh damping, and $(\upalpha1)[M_{g g}]$ Rayleigh damping. Where $\mathrm{\bfg}$ is set by PARAM,G,value, $w3$ is set by PARAM,W3,value; $w4$ is set by PARAM,W4,value; $\mathbf{\alpha}\mathbf{1}$ is set by PARAM,ALPHA1,value,0.;and $\mathbf{\alpha}\propto2$ is set by PARAM,ALPHA2,value,0.  

Additionally, $[B2H]$ modal damping can be included by use of the Case Control command $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{ḊAMPḌ=n} Ḍ$ . For part superelement or superelement analyses, modal damping for each individual part or superelement can be controlled by PARAM,SESDAMP,YES (PARAM,SESDAMP,NO is the default).  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">SESDAMP</td></tr><tr><td>sesdamp = no</td><td>Modal damping for each superelement using the free boundary modes.</td><td>SDAMP=> TABDMP1 SDAMP above subcase.</td></tr><tr><td>sesdamp = yes</td><td>Modal damping for each superelement using the fixed boundary CMS modes.</td><td>SDAMP=>TABDMP1 SDAMP in superelement subcase.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">For part superelements</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The Nastran/ADAMS interface does not allow for adding modal damping to structural damping using PARAM,KDAMP,-1.  

Direct input damping may also be included with the Case Control command $\mathtt{B2G G=n}$ . For part superelement or superelement analyses, use of this command with the Nastran/ADAMS interface requires fully expanded case control.  

18.If preload is present in the model, physical gridpoint stress and strain for the preload may be outpu to the .mnf using standard GPSTRESS $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ or GPSTRAIN $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ commands.  

If preload is generated in a SOL 106 run for a SOL 103 restart, and the physical grid point stresses for the preload are desired for the SOL 103 MNF run, then PARAM,FLEXNLS,YES is required above the subcase level in the SOL 106 run.  

For preload generated in a SOL 106 run for a SOL 103 restart, the preload subcase must be replicated in the first subcase of the SOL 103 run.  

19. After using the Nastran/ADAMS interface to produce an .mnf file and after preforming an ADAMS solution, it is possible to bring the ADAMS results into Nastran for modal data recovery. ADAMS produces .op2 files for input to Nastran SOL 11l and SOL 112. The files are binary format with an .mdf extension. The File Management Section requires an assign command for each file:  

ASSIGN INPUTT2 $\cdot=\prime$ name.mdf' UNIT $\mathop{\left.\sum}\right\vert=$ ni with a DLOAD $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ni in the appropriate subcase.  

Also, in the Bulk Data Section, the parameter PARAM,ADMPOST ${\bf\alpha}={\bf m}_{\bf\alpha}$ $\mathrm{\dot{\f}m}=0$ , by default no MSR performed) is required. If $\mathbf{m}=1$ , rigid body motion is not considered in the structural deformation. If $\mathbf{m}=2$ , rigid body motion is considered in the structural deformation.  

Full details of the generation of the .mdf files and their use with Nastran are to be found in the Nastran/ADAMS durability documentation.  

20. In order to obtain consistent ADAMS results in Nastran data recovery run, when ADAMS data brought back into Nastran SOL 11l or SOL 112, Nastran must be restarted from either of the following two options:  

a. From the original Nastran database that was produced during SOL103 MNF creation run (created MNF is used in ADAMS run).   
b. From the external SE (\*.op2) that was produced during SOL103 MNF creation run (created MNF is used in ADAMS run). The File Management section requires to assign command for external SE op2. ASSIGN INPUTT2 $\O=$ 'EXTSE100.OP2’UNIT $\c=$ ni with following PARAM entries PARAM ADMPOST,1 $\$5$ PARAM ADMEXTU ，ni $\$5$ Where ni $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ unit # of external SE op2. Note that ADMPOST $\overset{\cdot}{=}2$ is not supported with this restart option (via external SE op2)  

21. Typically SOL 400 is used to produce a preload for an ADAMS flexbody MNF run.  

a. In the preload run the structure should be statically supported and follower loading must be applied as a self equilibrating load set (not with SPC relationships!). In the ANALYSIS $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ MODES step the structure must be a free-free structure as the resulting orthonormalization requires that six rigid body modes be present.  

In order to produce modal amplitudes and mode shapes and to ensure residual vector calculations, SPOINTs and Q-sets are required. The SPOINTs must be included in the MAIN Bulk Data as they are included in the overall matrix size.  

A new BULK data section labeled BEGIN FLXBDY $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ id must be included with the run. This new bulk section must contain the Q-set associate with the SPOINTs (in main bulk!) for modal amplitudes and the A-set required for attachment point designation.  

The example below is a typical SOL400 problem setup:  

SOL 400   
CEND   
$\$5$ Case Control Section   
$\$5$ Output ADAMSMNF REQUIRED ABOVE SUBCASE  

ADAMSMNF flexbody $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ yes,psetid $\c=$ all,outgstrs $\c=$ yes, outgstrn $\c=$ yes SUBCASE 1 $\$5$ Preload STEP 10 $\$5$ Static load and support for preload SUBTITLE $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ PRELOAD ANALYSIS $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ NLSTATICS NLSTEP $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=\mathbf{\varepsilon}_{110}$ LOAD $\l=\ 120$ SPC $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=\mathbf{\varepsilon}_{130}$ $\tt B C O N T A C T\ =\ 140$ SPCF $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ ALL $\$5$ Generate stress and strain grid shapes STRESS（PLOT） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL STRAIN（PLOT） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL GPSTRESS（PLOT） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL GPSTRAIN（PLOT） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL \$ Modal Step for Producing MNF $\$5$ Default: Select the end of previous load step to output $\$5$ ADAMSMNF STEP 20 ANALYSIS $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ MODES $\$5$ Select real Eigen Value Parameters METHOD = 210 \$ Turn residual vectors on RESVEC $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ COMPONENT STRESS（PLOT） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL STRAIN（PLOT） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL GPSTRESS（PLOT） $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ ALL GPSTRAIN（PLOT） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL  

b. In the above example, the SPC set in the ANALYSIS $\dot{}=}$ NLSTAT must be a static (non-redundant) constraint condition. Note that in the ANALYSIS $\O=$ MODES STEP, the SPC constraint set has been removed.  

In SOL 400, the definition of the attachment a-set for identifying attachment points and for qset for specifying the desired number of modal amplitudes for orthonormalization is done in a separate new FLXBDY Bulk Data Section shown below:  

$\$5$ FLEXBODY Bulk section   
BEGIN BULK FLXBDY $\mathit{\Theta}=\mathit{\Theta}10$   
$\$5$ Attachment point and component mode (A-sET) selection   
ASET1,123456,1,11,111,121   
QSET1,0,100001,THRU,100020  

In SOL400, the ASET/ASET1 and QSET/QSET1, MUST, appear in the FLXBDY bulk data section.  

Currently, only one FLXBDY bulk data section (with a positive Flexbody ID) is supported in SOL 400. Any non set related Bulk entries appearing in this Section will be ignored.  

c. If CONTACT is required as part of the preloading for the FLEXBODY $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ YES run, it is Highly Recommended that the friction option be turned on by using an appropriate BCPARA bulk data entry setting, e.g.,  

$\$5$ Select bilinear Coulomb friction for all subcases BCPARA，O，FTYPE，6 If contact friction is not turned on, the tangential motion between the two parts coming into contact will most likely not be constrained and incorrect or fatal results will occur.  

d. If RIGID elements (RBE1/RBE2/RBE3/RBAR/RROD/RJOINT) are in the model, then the Case Control RIGID $\c=$ LAGRANGE (default for SOL400) should be used to avoid possible wrong results. If an attachment point happens to touch a rigid element, the point should be associated with the independent degree of freedom of the rigid element. Though not recommended, if for some modeling requirement, a dependent rigid element grid is required to be in the attachment set, the user MUST include at least one independent/reference grid for thai specific rigid element in the ASET.  

22. Real coupled method does not support in ADAMS interface. If Case Control METHOD(COUPLED) is used with ADAMSMNF FLEXBODY=yes, the folowing error message will be returned: \*USER FATAL MESSAGE 22985 (SUBDMAP IFPL) CASE CONTROL COMMAND METHOD(COUPLED) IS NOT SUPPORTED WITH THE NASTRAN/ADAMS INTERFACE.

Aerodynamic XY plane of symmetry flag. This is used to indicate whether the aerodynamic model has symmetry with respect to the ground.  

Format:  

$$
\mathrm{AESYMXY}=\left\{{\begin{array}{c}{{S Y M M E T R I C}}\\ {{A N T I S Y M M E T R I C}}\\ {{A S Y M M E T R I C}}\end{array}}\right\}
$$

2.If AESYMXY is present above the subcase level, it is applied to all subcases until overridden.  

3. SYMMETRIC implies ground effect, and ASYMMETRIC implies free air analysis.  

4. Multiple aerodynamic symmetries are supported.  

Aerodynamic XZ plane of symmetry flag.This is used to support symmetric models about the centerline.  

Format:  

$$
\mathrm{AESYMXZ}=\left\{{\cal A}N T I S Y M M E T R I C\right\}
$$  

Example: AESYMXZ $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ SYMMETRIC

Remark:  

1. If AESYMXZ is not present in case control, aerodynamic XZ symmetry willbe determined from the SYMXZ field of the AEROS Bulk Data entry for static aeroelastic analysis, and from the SYMXZ field of the AERO Bulk Data entry for flutter and dynamic aeroelastic analysis.  

2.If AESYMXZ is present above the subcase level, it is applied to all subcases until overridden.  

3. Multiple aerodynamic symmetries are supported.  

Reference UXVEC selector for the aeroelastic trim analysis.This is used to indicate an aerodynamic extra point vector about which the stability derivatives are to be computed and printed.The stability derivatives are the change in force due toa unit perturbation of each parameter in the aerodynamic extra point set. Due to the nonlinear nature of the aeroelastic loads,the stability derivatives can be (but are not required to be)a function of the point about which the slope is computed. This input defines which point is to be used in computing the stability derivatives for printing (local slopes willbe computed as needed in the trim solver). This selection is typically done within each subcase, but a case control default can be defined by placing an entry above the subcase level.  

Format:  

$$
\operatorname{AEUXREF}={\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{\ n}\\ {T R I M}\end{array}\right\}}
$$  

Examples: AEUXREE $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=100$ AEUXREF $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ TRIM  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>The identification number of a UXVEC Bulk Data entry that defines the point about which stability derivatives will be computed in TRIM cases.</td></tr><tr><td>TRIM</td><td>Indicates that the stability derivatives should be computed about the trimmed state.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. If,for a particular subcase, AEUXREF is not defined,the“free stream"state will be used (that is, th stability derivatives willbe computed about zero values for all parameters). This results in upward compatibility with the linear database paradigm.   
2. Only one of a TRIM or a UXVEC ID may be specified on any given subcase. To see stability derivatives about additional points, you must define additional trim subcases.

# Remarks:  

1. This entry is used in solution sequences that are capable of multiple analysis types and selects the actual analysis to be performed in the SUBCASE (or for SOL 40O the SUBCASE, STEP, or SUBSTEP).  

·For linear solution sequences SOLs l10, 11l, and 112 and the nonlinear SOLs 106, 153, and 159, and for Optimization SOL 200 there can be only one ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ per SUBCASE   
· SOL 600,153 and SOL 600,159 require ANALYSIS $\begin{array}{r}{{\bf\Psi}=\frac{\d{\bf\Psi}}{\d t}}\end{array}$ HEAT. For other SOL 600,ID executive control entries, ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ is not used and should not be entered.   
For SOL 200, EVERY SUBCASE including any superelement SUBCASE must be assigned an ANALYSIS $\c=$ Case Control command either in the explicit SUBCASE or above all SUBCASEs in which case it defaults to all the subcases. For SOL 40o there can, for single physics analysis or chained multi physics analysis, be only one ANALYSIS $\c=$ per STEP.   
For SOL 400 coupled multi physics analysis there can be only one ANALYSIS $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ per SUBSTEP.  

2. In the linear solution sequences SOLs 110, 1ll,112 this entry allows data recovery of the normal modes data used in the in the complex Eigenvalue analysis, modal frequency analysis, or modal transient analysis. All commands which control the boundary conditions (SPC, MPC, and SUPORT) and METHOD selection should be copied inside the ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES SUBCASE or specified above the SUBCASE level. Note in the example below, SOL1ll is a frequency response solution sequence so in the frequency response SUBCASE 2 below an ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ MFREQis allowed but not required.  

SOL 111 METH $\scriptstyle=40$ $\mathrm{SPC=1}$ SUBCASE 1 $\$5$ Normal Modes ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES DISP $\c=$ ALL SUBCASE 2 $\$5$ Frequency response STRESS $\O=$ ALL DLOAD=12 $\mathtt{F R E Q=4}$  

3. SOL 400 analysis allows for seven analysis type combinations (nonlinear single physics, nonlinear chained physics, nonlinear coupled physics, linear perturbation analysis, standard linear physics, nonlinear chained analysis with mesh/time change physics, and nonlinear response optimization with ESLNRO (Equivalent Static Loads Nonlinear Response Optimization)).  

If there are linear, nonlinear and perturbation subcases,the linear subcases willbe solved first. The linear subcases are reordered for processing and the output will be in the following order regardless of original subcase number: STATICS, MODES, BUCKLING, DFREQ or MFREQ, DCEIG or MCEIG, SAERO,FLUTTER.  

The general rule is: The solutions of all SUBCASEs are independent of each other. The solution of any STEP is a continuation of the solution of the previous STEP in the same SUBCASE. The solutions of the SUBSTEPs occur simultaneously within a STEP (coupled analysis):  

Additionally the following rules should be observed:  

· All Coupled Multi-Physics steps have to come before the Single-Physics steps.   
· Single-Physics steps can follow the Multi-Physics Steps.   
· All linear perturbation steps need to be at the end after definition of allpossible coupled multiphysics steps and single-physics steps.   
The Case Control Command NLIC used for Nonlinear Initial Condition should be referenced for further requirements between the analysis types allowed in SOL 400.   
a. Nonlinear single physics: Nonlinear structures or nonlinear heat: For nonlinear structures a ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTAT must come before a ANALYSIS $\begin{array}{r}{=}{}\end{array}$ NLTRAN. Only Statics to Transient is allowed for structures. For heat transfer a nonlinear steady state heat transfer to a nonlinear transient heat transfer is not allowed.  

A structural example:  

SUBCASE 1 STEP 10 ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTAT   
STEP 20 ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTAT STEP 30 ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLTRAN  

b. Nonlinear chained physics: A nonlinear steady state heat with results used for a nonlinear static structural analysis. Only a steady state heat to a structural nonlinear Statics is allowed.  

SUBCASE 1 STEP 10 ANALYSIS $\c=$ HSTAT STEP 20 ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTAT  

c. Nonlinear coupled physics: This allows for four combinations of STEP/SUBSTEP within the SUBCASE ：ANALYSIS $\c=$ HSTAT for the first SUBSTEP and ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLSTAT for the second SUBSTEP ANALYSIS $\c=$ HTRAN for the first SUBSTEP and ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLTRAN for the second SUBSTEP ）ANALYSIS $\c=$ HTRAN for the first SUBSTEP and ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLSTAT for the second SUBSTEP  

ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ HSTAT for the first SUBSTEP and ANALYSIS $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ NLTRAN for the second SUBSTEP  

A coupled analysis example is:  

SUBCASE 100 STEP 10 STRESS $\c=$ ALL NLSTRESS $\c=$ ALL NLSTE $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{P}=84}$ SUBSTEP 1 ANALYSIS $\c=$ HSTAT THERMAL $\c=$ ALL FLUX $\varXi$ ALL SPC=35 LOAD=11 ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTAT $\mathrm{SPC}=2$ LOAD $\scriptstyle\mathtt{\Lambda})=110$ DISP(PLOT) $\b=\b1$ 456 STEP 20 ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLTRAN (single physics rules follow)  

d. Linear perturbation analysis: Linear perturbation analysis is run directly after a nonlinear static (ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTAT) analysis using additional STEP commands containing ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ BUCK, MODES, DFREQ, MFREQ,MTRAN, DCEIG, and MCEIG entries.  

It should be noted that ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ BUCK for linear perturbation is not recommended if the model is highly nonlinear. NLBUCK Case Control command is recommended for highly nonlinear models.

The subsequent mechanical job can have both a different mesh than the heat job and different time steps.

g. Nonlinear response optimization with ESLNRO: A standard single physics nonlinear ANALYSIS $\dot{\bf\Phi}=\dot{\bf\Phi}$ NLSTAT is performed with a NASTRAN ESLOPT $\stackrel{\cdot}{=}1$ in the bulk data file. Besides the usual model grid, loads, element data etc., the bulk data file should contain the standard SOL 200 design criteria.  

An example:

4. In SOL 106, the ANALYSIS Case Control command may be used to define alinear perturbation analysis SUBCASE or a user input of the 'stressd' or deformed geometry (normal bulk data input) and ‘unload' the structure to determine the unstressed shape SUBCASE.  

a.‘Linear perturbation analysis: The ANALYSIS Case Control command may be used to define a linear' perturbation analysis SUBCASE, separate from the subcases used to load the model. Normal modes and frequency response subcases with ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES or ANALYSIS $\O=$ DFREQ will use the final displacement results and loads from the previous nonlinear subcase to generate the stiffness, differential stiffness, and follower force matrices for use in the linear response analyses. Data recovery wil be based on the requests above and within the subcase.  

An example is:  

SUBCASE 1 $\$5$ LOAD STRUCTURE $\mathtt{L O A D}=\ 100$ $\mathrm{\DeltaNLPARM=\Delta~10(}$ )   
SUBCASE 2 $\$5$ NORMAL MODES ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES METHOD $\c=$ 100 DISP $\c=$ ALL   
SUBCASE 3 $\$5$ FREQUENCY RESPONSE ANALYSIS $\c=$ DFREQ SET $100=\ 1$ THRU 1000 $\mathsf{D I S P}\boldsymbol{=}\mathrm{~100~}$   
SUBCASE 4 $\$5$ CONTINUE LOADING STRUCTURE $\mathtt{I O A D}=\ 200$ NLPARM $\c=$ 100 $\scriptstyle\mathrm{{DISP=}}$ ALL   
SUBCASE 5 $\$5$ NORMAL MODES AT THE NEW LOADING ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES  

In the previous example, subcases 2 and 3 will use the results from subcase l, subcase 4 will continue the loading application,and subcase 5 will use the results from subcase 4.For the linear analyses, the mass matrix will be based on the undeformed geometry and the damping matrix will be generated using the deformed geometry. This willallow analyses of flarge' displacement results (PARAM, LGDISP, 1), in addition to material nonlinear analyses.  

b. User input of the ‘stressed' or deformed geometry: ANALYSIS $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ HOT2COLD allows the user to input the‘stressed' or deformed geometry (normal bulk data input) and ‘unload' the structure to determine the unstressed shape. This uses an iterative technique with each iteration a nonlinear analysis.This feature will also ‘reset the geometry to the ‘unstressed' position for additional subcases. Related PARAMETERS are HTOCTOL, HTOCITS, and HTOCPRT.  

An example is:  

SUBCASE 1   
$\$5$ UNLOAD STRUCTURE ANALYSIS $\c=$ HOT2COLD $\mathrm{\DeltaLOAD=\Delta100}$ NLPARM $\varXi$ 100   
SUBCASE 2   
\$ NORMAL MODES UNLOADED STRUCTURE ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES METHOD $\c=$ 100 DISP $\c=$ ALL   
SUBCASE 3   
\$ LOAD the STRUCTURE $\mathrm{\DeltaLOAD=\Delta100}$ NLPA $\mathrm{\sfRM}=\mathrm{\boldmath~\underline{{{10}}}(\mathrm{\boldmath~\Omega~}}$ 0   
SUBCASE 4   
$\$5$ NORMAL MODES OF LOADED STRUCTURE ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES METHOD $\l=\ 100$ $\scriptstyle\mathrm{{DISP=}}$ ALL  

SUBCASE 1 unloads the model. SUBCASE 2 calculates the modes of the‘undeformed' structure; the differential stiffnessand follower force effects will not be included. SUBCASE 3 loads the model. SUBCASE 4 calculates the modes of the loaded structure; the differential stiffness and follower forces effects will be included.

1. AUTOSPC specifies the action to take when singularities exist in the stiffness matrix. AUTOSPC $\dot{\mathbf{\Omega}}=\dot{\mathbf{\Omega}}$ YES means that singularities will be constrained automatically. AUTOSPC $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NO means that singularities will not be constrained. If AUTOSPC $\begin{array}{r}{{\bf\Psi}=\frac{\d{\bf\Psi}}{\d t}}\end{array}$ NO, then the user should take extra caution analyzing the results of the grid point singularity table and the computed epsilons.See Constraint and Mechanism Problem Identification in SubDMAP SEKR in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide for details of singularity and mechanism identification and constraint.  

2. Singularity ratios smaller than EPSSING are listed as potentially singular. If AUTOSPC $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ YES, then the identified singularities with a ratio smaller than EPS willbe automatically constrained. If EPSSING has the same value as EPS,then allsingularities are listed.If EPSSING is larger than EPS, the printout of singularity ratios equal to exactly zero is suppressed. EPSSING must be greater than or equal to EPS. If not, the program will set EPSSING equal to EPS.  

3.If the PUNCH keyword is specified, then automatically generated SPCs or MPCs are placed in SPCi or MPCi Bulk Data entry format on the PUNCH file.  

4.By default, in allsolution sequences except 106, 129 and 400, the auto-SPC operation is performed for both superelements and the residual structure. (Auto-SPC processing is disabled in heat transfer analysis). In SOLs 106, 129 and 400,the default is to perform the operation only on superelements. If it is desired to perform auto-SPC on the residual structure in:  

a. SOLs 106, then specify PARAM,AUTOSPCR,YES and is only applied to the omitted degreesof-freedom. The AUTOSPC command is ignored for the residual structure.   
b. SOLs 129, then specify PARAM,AUTOSPCR,YES. The AUTOSPC command is ignored for the residual structure.   
c. For SOL 400, see Remarks 6. and 7.  

5. The MPC option may be somewhat more expensive than the SPC option. However, it provides more realistic structural modeling than the SPC. When the MPC option is selected, the multipoint constraint may be applied on some degree of freedom for which the stiffness matrix is identified as singular. If the MPC is inapplicable to some degree of freedom, the SPC is used instead.  

6. For SOL 400, if RESIDUAL option is requested, the AUTOSPC operation is applied to both the residual structure and the superelements. Without RESIDUAL option, the AUTOSPC operation is applied to the superelements only. For default (no AUTOSPCE command), AUTOSPC operation is not applied to the residual structure, but it is applied to the superelements. Both parameters PARAM,AUTOSPC and PARAM,AUTOSPCR have no effect in SOL 400. Please note that the AUTOSPC (RESIDUAL) command should not be used in the geometrical nonlinear analysis, because it may over constrain the structural model.  

7. For SOL 400, the AUTOSPC (RESIDUAL) command can be placed above the subcase level, between subcase and step,and below the step level. The AUTOSPC operation is performed each step of a subcase if it is required. In the folowing example, step 10 uses SPC option, step 20 uses MPC option, and no AUTOSPC operation is performed for step 30.  

SUBCASE 1 STEP 10 AUTOSPC（RESIDUAL,SPC） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ YES LOAD $\mathit{\Theta}=\ 10$  

STEP 20 AUTOSPC（RESIDUAL,MPC） $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ YES $\tt L O A D\ =\ 20$   
STEP 30 $\tt L O A D\ =\ 30$  

For superelements, only one AUTOSPC command can be specified. Ifthere are multiple AUTOSPC commands in the Case Control packet, the one for the first step of the first subcase willbe used. In the previous example, the AUTOSPC under step 10 is used.  

8. For SOL 400, AUTOSPC equals YES for linear perturbation if DOMAINSOLVER ACMS is defined in the executive system.   
9. For SOL 101 with contact, user can turn on AUTOSPC by using RESIDUAL option. i.e., when AUTOSPC(RESIDUAL) $\c=$ YES, AUTOSPC will be turned on for linear analysis with contact.   
10. This entry is not supported by SOL 600. Please enter PARAM,AUTOSPC in the bulk data.

DISP(PLOT) = 101   
STRESS(PLOT) = 102  

above, the displacement and velocity can only be recovered on set 10l and stresses on set 102 during step-2 (data recovery).  

DISP $\sqsupseteq$ ALL, STRESS $\O=$ ALL, STRAIN $\stackrel{\cdot}{=}.$ ALL, etc., should be used carefully for large models during step-l as it could lead to significant performance degradation and large external SE .op2 file size.  

3.AVLEXCTETMsupportsthe followingflexbodytypes whichwillbe set automaticallybasedon the user inputs of AVLEXB case controls:  

a. CON6: Is General large motion flexbody which is selected when the user enters “NOD6 $\c=$ NO' and“MASINVAR $\v{x}=$ FULL/FIRST".   
b. SMOT: Is Small motion flexbody which is selected when the user enters “NOD6 $\c=$ NO” and "MASINVAR $\c=$ NONE”.   
c. NOD6: Is a special flexbody model consisting of pure bar/beam (1-D) elements with concentrated masses. It is selected when the user enters $\mathrm{^{*}N O D6=Y E S^{\mathrm{*}}}$ . Here the dictionary table for bar/beam elements for each bear/beam element shall be outputted into the EXB file. NOD6 automatically means that the following are not calculated and output into the EXB file: (1） Mass invarients, (2) Recovery Matrix, (3) A-set Orthonormalization and associated Eigenvalue/Eigenvector and (4) Component modes.  

4. MSC Nastran does not export KELM to EXB file for NOD6 body.AVL EXCITETM v2019 provides a utility to calculate and write KELM to existing EXB file.  

5. Degree of freedom (dof) table (DOFTtable) is written to EXB file for the following dof sets:  

a. A-set : Dof table for a-set are always written out to the EXB file. b. $_{\mathrm{O+M}}$ -set : Dof table for $\mathbf{o}{+}\mathbf{m}$ -set are only written out to the EXB file if the recovery matrix is requested by the user. In case the user selects partial recovery by specifying the EXBOSET only a subset of $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathrm{o+m}}$ -set would be output in the dof Table.   
6. GEOM table contains the coordinates of nodes in MSC Nastran basic coordinate system. Two table of coordinates are always written to the EXB file: (1) A-set and (2) $\mathrm{F}{+}\mathrm{M}.$ -set.   
7. OUTGSTRS or OUTGSTRN entries require the use of the standard MSC Nastran $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{TRESS=}$ or STRAIN $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ Case Control commands used in conjunction with GPSTRESS= or GPSTRAIN $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ Case Control commands to produce modal grid point stress or strain. They also require the use of PARAM,POST,-1 or PARAM,POST,1. GSTRESS(PLOT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ or GPSTRAIN(PLOT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ will suppress grid stress or strain output to the MSC Nastran .fO6 file.The modal grid point stress or strain are not output to the EXB file but to standard MSC Nastran .op2 file.   
8. The default value of “N $\mathrm{\ASINV{AR}=F U L L^{\circ}}$ calculates all the mass invariants. In case oflarge models the calculations of higher order mas invariants can be time consuming; hence, it is recommended that the user first run with either“MASINVAR $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ FIRST" or“MASINVAR $\scriptstyle=\mathrm{NONE}^{\prime\prime}$ to validate the model.   
9. MFFEXP $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ YES requests output of Mass matrix of $\mathrm{F}{+}\mathrm{M}$ set and requires the user to request full recovery(RECOVRYM $\dot{.}=\dot{}$ YES and $\mathrm{EXBOSET}=\mathrm{ALL})$ ·  

10. Typically SOL 400 is used to produce a preloaded AVL EXCITETM EXB file.  

a. Standard SOL 400 nonlinear analysis prohibits the existence of an o-set; hence the EXTSEOUT case control must be used (see above Remark 2.).   
b. In the preload run the structure should be statically supported and follower loading must be applied as a selfequilibrating load set (not with SPC relationships!). In the ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ MODES step, usually, the structure should be a free-free structure to preserve its six rigid body modes. In order to produce modal amplitudes and mode shapes and to ensure residual vector calculations, SPOINTs and Q-sets are required.  

The example below is a typical SOL400 problem setup:  

ASSIGN OUTPUT2 $\c=$ 'seplt3rbe.out2',UNIT $\scriptstyle=80$ ,DELETE

STRAIN(PLOT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL   
GPSTRESS(PLOT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL   
GPSTRAIN(PLOT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL  

c. In the above example, the SPC set in the ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLSTAT must be a static (nonredundant) constraint condition. Note that in the ANALYSIS $\c=$ MODES STEP, the SPC constraint set has been removed. The definition of the attachment a-set for identifying attachment points and for q-set for specifying the desired number of modal amplitudes for orthonormalization should be done in the main bulk data section, e.g.:  

\$ Main Bulk section $\$5$ Attachment point and component mode (A-sET) selection ASET1,123456,1,11,111,121 QSET1,0,100001,THRU,100020 d. If CONTACT is required as part of the preloading, it is highly recommended that the friction option be turned on by using an appropriate BCPARA bulk data entry setting, e.g., $\$5$ Select bilinear Coulomb friction for all subcases BCPARA，O，FTYPE，6 If contact friction is not turned on, the tangential motion between the two parts coming into contact will most likely not be constrained and incorrect or fatal results will occur.   
11. The AVL EXCITETM solver expects singularities, other than the rigid body modes,of the model to be constrained; hence,it is recommended that the user constrain singularities automatically using the PARAM,AUTOSPC in SOL 103 and AUTOSPC (RESIDUAL) command in SOL 400.   
12. After conducting the AVL EXCITETM simulation the data recovery is conducted in SOL 111, SOL   
112 and SOL 400 using the EXTSEOUT feature. Using External SE to conduct data recovery would make the data recovery faster and minimize the database size by storing only the information required for recovery. The user interface for data recovery is straightforward requiring the atachment of the SE databases, stored on the .op2 file, generated in the SE generation step during EXB file export together with the ASM and PCH files.   
13.During the data recovery it should be noted that PARAM,POST setting for the External SE are not picked up from the main bulk. If physical quantities inside External SE (stresses,etc) are to be output to op2 the user can add PARAM,POST in the case control if they want it applied globally or add PARAM,POST manualy to the External SE pch file.   
14. Virtual mass is supported in MSC Nastran-AVL EXCITETM Interface through the use of standard VMOPT parameter entry.   
15. Real coupled method does not support in AVL EXCITE^TM interface. If Case Control METHOD(COUPLED) is used with AVLEXB EXBBODY $\c=$ yes, the following error message will be returned: \*USER FATAL MESSAGE 22984 (SUBDMAP IFPL) CASE CONTROL COMMAND METHOD(COUPLED) IS NOT SUPPORTED WITH THE NASTRAN/AVL EXCITE INTERFACE.

Overview of contact type definition:  

General Contact - two bodies may come into contact and separate at any point in the simulation and the bodies may slidealone eachother's surface with or without friction.The fundamentalconstraint is no relative normal displacement when bodies are in contact. General contact is available in SOL 101, SOL 400, SOL 600 or SOL 700 only.For SOL 10l, contact is the only source of nonlinearity, no large displacements, large rotations or material nonlinearity is available.  

Glued Contact - two bodies may come into contact and separate at any point in thesimulation,but when in contact there is no relative sliding. The fundamental constraint is no relative normal displacement or tangential displacement when bodies are in contact.One can consider this equivalent to two surfaces that have infinite friction. Note that the word glued, only refers to the constraint on the tangential behavior. Bodies that are in glued contact may lose contact ifthe separation (force or stressbased) separation criteria is exceeded, due to Unglue or Breaking Glue.  

Step Glued Contact - this is available for SOL 40O only. Step Glued contact is activated using a value a negative value of IGLUE for each contact pair. It is similar to Glued Contact, there are two conditions.  

1.The contact status willbe checked atthe beginning of the step,and those nodes or segments that are in contact will remain in glued contact for the entire step. The constraints will change due to large rotations. Furthermore if a large tensile force or stress developed over the interface in the current loadcase, no separation would occur for these regions which are initially in contact.. Performing an Unglue of Breaking glue would also not be enforced during the step for these regions. This may be successfully used to model the union of dissimilar meshes, where at a later time one wanted to separate the bodies (like opening of a door).   
2.When using Step Glue conventional contact occurs for the nodes/segments of the body which are not in contact at the beginning of the step. That means when they come into contact, they willglue, but they may separate within the same step.  

Permanently Glued Contact -this is a special case of contact, where the initial configuration is used to determine the contact constraint, and these contact changes due notchange throughout the analysis. Nodes or segments which are not initialy in contact do not come into contact,and in fact may penetrate the model. The constraint is aglue type, meaning there willbeno relative normal or tangential displacement.Permanent glued may be used to connect dissimilar meshes or for simple assembly modeling when no other contact occurs.The bodies willnever separate. Permanent glue should not be used in models that experience large rotations.It is applicable to SOL 101,103,105,107, 108,109,110,111,112,SOL 200 and SOL 400. Permanent Glued contact is activated if the BCTABLE or BCTABLl that is referenced in the first Loadcase (SOL $100^{*})$ or in the first Step (SOL 200) has a value of IGLUE greater than zero for all contact body pairs.  

If the user requires conventional (general)contact for the complete simulation,but Permanent Glued contact is invoked, enter bulk data BCPARA,0,NLGLUE,1 to deactivate the Permanent Glue in a subsequent step.  

If large rotation/deformation effect present, turn on SYSTEM(758) $^{=2}$ will switch Permanently Glued Contact to Step Glued Contact automatically in SOL 400.  

Because glued contact is very useful in assembly modeling problems encountered in engineering practice, several special cases are considered as well.  

Moment Carrying Glue - For General Contact - when a node or surface comes into contact the default condition is that constraints are only placed on the translational degrees offreedom. When Moment Carrying Glue is activated the rotational degrees of freedom are also constrained to ensure moment carrying behavior. This may be used with either beam elements or shell elements.  

Symmetry Contact - Deformable contact with a rigid Symmetry surface. In this case no friction is allowed. Furthermore no separation is allowed, and finaly if the rigid surface iscontacted by beams or shell - the rotations are automatically constrained to satisfy the symmetry constraints.You do not need to specify any additional input, other than specifying that the rigid surface is a SYMM body.

Remarks:  

BCONTACT is recognized in SOLs 101, 400, and 700, and under the special condition of permanent glued contact in SOLs 103,105,107, 108,109, 110, 111,112 and 200.The standard SOL 200(without calling SOL 400) can only support permanent glue; but when SOL 200 calls SOL 400(or say SOL 400 optimization), it can support all contact types. For SOLs 101 and 400, if the form BCONTACT $\mathbf{\chi}_{=\mathbf{n}}^{\prime}$ is applied in any loadcase (subcase or step), Nastran looks into the Bulk Data file to get all BCTABLE, BCTABL1 or BCONECT (required), BCMOVE (optional) and BCHANGE (optional), in the same $S I D=\mathrm{n}$ . The user can always specify Case Control commands, BCMOVE and/or BCHANGE, to select different SID. BCONTACT $\scriptstyle-0$ can invoke initial preload contact conditions, such that the contact bodies will just touch each other before analysis begins, but it's not necessary. If presence of BCTABLE, O, initial contact condition will also be processed, no matter if BCONTACT $_{=0}$ is given or not.(please refer to BCTABLE, 0 for more information). The contact analysis during any loadcase is dominated by BCONTACT $\mathbf{\dot{\tau}}_{=\mathbf{n}}$ $(\mathrm{n}{>}0)$ . Without presence of BCONTACT $\scriptstyle{\dot{=}}\mathbf{n}$ $(\mathrm{n}{>}0)$ , no contact analysis works in that particular loadcase. In SOL 400 one can have multiple contact interaction types in the model meaning general contact glued contact, step contact on a contact pair basis. These can change from step to step by activating a new BCTABLE or BCTABL1. SOL 700 allows only one BCONTACT Case Control command and only one subcase. 3. For SOLs 101 and 400,if the form BCONTACT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ ALLBODY is applied in any loadcase (subcase or step), Nastran does not look into corresponding BCTABLE, BCTABLl or BCONECT but uses the defaults for allentries on BCTABLE, BCONPRG or BCONPRP. If the user wants to specify BCMOVE and/or BCHANGE Bulk Data entries,the BCMOVE and/or BCHANGE Case Control commands must be given.  

4.Permanent glued contact for smalldeformation and rotation is initiated by BCONTACT $\mathrel{\mathop{=}}\mathrm{n}$ pointing to BCTABLE/BCONECT referring a valid positive IGLUE field. If all slave's for the BCTABLE or BCONPRG corresponding to the first loadcase (first subcase and first step) contain IGLUE ${>}0$ , permanent glued contact with small rotation condition will be used for all SLAVE entries in all subcases and all steps unless BCPARA,0,NLGLUE,1 is specified. If IGLUE $<0$ exists, step glue is activated to support large deformation and large rotation.   
5. For glue contact (PGLUE, GGLUE, and SGLUE),default is to implement the moment carrying glue without node projection, i.e., Insures full moment carrying glue when shell contact. The node wil not be projected onto the contact body and an existing initial gap or overlap between the node and the contacted body will not be removed, as the node willnot be projected onto the contacted body. Unless IGLUE is defined in BCAUTOP.   
6. CTYPE can be specified by bulk data section BCAUTOP also, the value of CTYPE in BCAUTOP will be used if it is specified.   
7. When BCONTACT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ AUTO is specified, acg file will be generated. An acg file is a file consists of all generated contact bodies, contact pairs and parameters. The name of acg file can be specified by ASSIGN FMS statement.   
8. When BCONTACT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ AUTO is specified, only elements in residual structure are used to construct contact bodies in superelement models.   
9. BEAMB in bulk data entry BCPARA is set to 1 when BCONTACT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Phi}$ AUTO is specified.  

This entry is used to initiate and control 3D contact in SOL 600.  

Standard subcase rules apply and BCONTACT may be specified within each subcase to define which bodies may make contact during that particular subcase. A BCONTACT $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=0$ above the subcase level is used in SOL 600 to invoke an option such that the contact surfaces willjust touch each other before the nonlinear simulation begins. It is highly recommended that if contact is specified for any subcase in SOL 600,and if there are any rigid contact surfaces, BCONTACT $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=0$ and a matching BCTABLE with $\mathrm{ID}=0$ be included.

# Remarks:  

1. Normall, only one form of this entry may be used in any given analysis.Analysis restarts must use the same form as the original run.An exception is that if BCONTAC $\Gamma=\mathrm{NONE}$ is entered for any subcase, BCONTACT $\mathrm{\Phi^{\prime}=N}$ may also be specified for different subcases. BCONTACT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Phi}$ ALLxxx cannot be mixed with BCONTACT $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ NONE or BCONTACT $\mathrm{\dot{\bar{\rho}}_{=N}}$ in the same input file.   
2. Bulk Data entries BCBOX, BCPROP, and BCMATL may be used with $\mathtt{B C O N T A C T}=\mathtt{n}$ ,wherein case IDs specified on the BCBODY entry and on the BCBOX, BCPROP, and/or BCMATL entries must match.   
3. For options ALLELE,ALLELE2, ALLGLUE,ALLGLU2, ALLGLUM, and ALLGLM2, no BCBODY or BCTABLE entries should be included in the model. Nastran willautomatically create BCBODY and/or BCTABLE entries as necessary for these options.   
4. The ALLELE option requires that the model be made up of either allshells or all solids.   
5. The ALLELE2 option requires that the model have both shells and solids.   
6. The ALLGLUE, ALLGLU2, ALLGLUM and ALLGLM4 options can be used with models with shells only, solids only for a combination of shells and solids.   
7. The ALLGLUP option can either be used with BCBODY/BCTABLE entries or without them. If there are not BCBODY/BCTABLE entries, SOL 600 will create them. If they exist, all SLAVE lines on all BCTABLE entries must specify IGLUE $_{.=1}$ ，   
8.The ALLG\*options are not available for edge contact.Edge contact may only be run using BCONTACT $\mathrm{\Phi^{\prime}=N}$ and the corresponding BCTABLE having a FBSH line with COPS1 and/or COPM1 properly specified.

Remarks:  

1. BEGIN BULK is not required but it is highly recommended that the user supply it. If not specified, then the program willautomatically insert one, before the first unique bulk type entry. Parameters are not considered unique bulk type entries so automatic BEGIN BULK inclusion willcome after any parameter that precedes entries unique to bulk.   
2. For an auxiliary model, AUXMID is referenced by the AUXMODEL Case Control command.   
3. Partitioned Bulk Data Sections defined by BEGIN SUPER are used to define only one superelement each. Bulk Data commands which define superelements are ignored in partitioned Bulk Data Sections. Superelements specified by a BEGIN SUPER entry can be automatically attached to other superelements based on relative locations of grid points. For connection to the downstream superelement, the global coordinate directions of the attachment grid points of the upstream superelement will be internally transformed to the global coordinate directions of the grid points of the downstream superelement. For displacement data recovery, the output will be in the original global coordinate directions.   
4. An acoustic field point mesh section defined by BEGIN AFPM is used to define one acoustic field point mesh.Acoustic field point meshes are used for postprocessing of acoustic results in the far field only; i.e., at locations within the acoustic infinite elements.   
5. The BEGIN SUPER, BEGIN AUXMODEL, and BEGIN AFPM Bulk Data entries must lie between BEGIN BULK and ENDDATA.   
5. When employing part superelements using the BEGIN BULK SUPER (or BEGIN SUPER) entry, it should be noted that any parameters that are specified in the main Bulk Data Section apply only to the residual and not to any of the part superelements.Accordingly, to apply certain parameters to all of the superelements,they must be specified in the Case Control Section, or explicitly in all of the BEGIN BULK SUPER (or BEGIN SUPER) portions of the Bulk Data.A common example of such a parameter specification is PARAM,POST, which is used to request postprocessing of results.   
7. arbmid can be referenced under the OUTM keyword of the PBMSECT Bulk Data entry to define the geometry of the arbitrary beam cross-section.   
8.For model using user defined subroutines, the subroutines can be put in the UDS section. Nastran can build user service from the subroutines using command line keyword ud $\begin{array}{r}{\mathfrak{z}=\mathbf{\ell}}\end{array}$ model. See the document User Defined Service User's Guide for detail.   
9. The parameter WTMASS is supported for trim components with a PARAM, WTMASS, value in each BEGIN TRMC $\scriptstyle={\mathrm{n}}$ Bulk Data.   
10. BEGIN MODULE command can only be specified after the BEGIN BULK or an ENDMODULF command has already been specified. In other words,a Module Bulk Data section cannot be nested inside another Module's Bulk Data section.   
11. The same module identification number can appear multiple times if APPEND is specified,otherwise a user fatal message will be issued.

# Remarks:  

1. The CMSENRGY command may be requested in the modal solution sequences (SOLs 110, 111, 112, 145, 146, 200) and the real eigenvalue analysis solution sequences (SOLs 103 and 106). It is intended for use when superelements are defined and component modal synthesis techniques are employed. (See the MODALKE and MODALSE Case Control commands for other options.)   
2. ESORT, FILTER, and TOPN describers apply only to QSET results output.TOTAL results output is always in increasing order of superelement ID number.   
3. QSET CMS energy ratios are output in increasing order of component mode number unless the ESORT keyword specifies a particular sorting order. If a sorting order is specified, the magnitude of the energy ratio is sorted. DESCEND can be used as a synonym for RATIO.   
4.The FILTER keyword specifies an absolute value that is used to limit the amount of printed output produced. It is applied to the magnitude of the CMS energy ratio. If the CMS energy ratio magnitude is less than fratio for any natural mode, no output for that natural mode is produced. THRESH can be used as a synonym for FILTER.   
5. In order to obtain unforced response (RESPONSE $\v{x}_{1}=$ BOTH or MODAL) output in SOL 11l and SOL 112, a subcase containing the ANALYSIS $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ MODES option must be present.   
6. For modal transient response solution sequences, response quantities are real numbers.There are no imaginary terms. Therefore, polar representations of the data have no meaning.  

Selects control system schedule information.  

Format: ${\mathrm{CSSCHD}}={\mathrm{n}}$  

Example: CSSCHD=10   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a control system schedule that appears on a CSSCHD Bulk Data entry.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remark:  

1. One or more CSSCHD Bulk Data entries can be invoked by this Case Control command.  

Requests form and type of output for p-version elements.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>SORT1</td><td>Output will be presented as a tabular listing of grid point results per loadcase.</td></tr><tr><td>SORT2</td><td>Output will be presented as a tabular listing of loadcase per grid point.</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>SID of OUTPUT Bulk Data entry to be used. Only displacements, stresses, and strains of p-version elements with identification numbers that appear on the OUTPUT Bulk Data entry with SID=n will be output (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. DATAREC is processed only when an adaptive analysis is requested.   
2. Only one command per subcase is allowed.   
3. This information is used only for output control and does not affect the analysis.   
4. Displacements, stresses, and strains willbe calculated and printed only for p-version elements on OUTPUT Bulk Data entries. Those elements listed that are not p-version elements will be ignored.   
5.The coordinates of the view points (points at which the displacements are calculated and printed) can be printed by using the VUGRID command.  

Selects saving of datablocks ofadvanced nonlinear elements for static and transient nonlinear analysis in SOL 400.

Remarks:  

1.DBSAVE can be applied above allthe subcases, within subcases,and steps. DBSAVE above all the subcases is going to be applied to all the subcases.   
2.If DBSAVE is present both above subcase and in step,the DBSAVE in step is dominant and used to control datablocks saving in this step.   
3. When DBSAVE $_{,=-1}$ , advanced nonlinear element can't be used in Linear Perturbation or other analysis step with NLIC.  

Indicates which DEACTEL Bulk Data entry is used to control the elements to be deactivated in a single physics job, or a particular physics pass of a coupled job. SOL 40O for NLSTATIC, and NLTRAN, as well Perturbation analyses only.

Example: DEACTEL $^{.=2}$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>ID of a matching DEACTEL Bulk Data entry specifying the elements to be deactivated.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1.Usage is limited to the first subcase (or prior to it),the first stepor the first substep of a particular physics pass. Elements are deactivated at the start of the job or the start of the particular physics pass and remain deactivated for the entire job.   
2. Elements deactivated can not be reactivated at later stage in the analysis.  

Selects the element deformation set.  

Format: DEFORM $\mathtt{\Gamma}_{=\mathtt{n}}$  

Example: DEFORM $[=27$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification number of DEFORM Bulk Data entries (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. DEFORM Bulk Data entries will not be used unless selected by the DEFORM command in the Case Control Section.   
2. DEFORM is only applicable in linear statics, inertia relief, differential stiffness, and buckling problems (SOLs 101, 105, 114, and 200), and will produce a fatal messge in other solution sequences.   
3. The total load applied will be the sum of external (LOAD), thermal (TEMP(LOAD)), elemeni deformation (DEFORM), and constrained displacement loads (SPC, SPCD).   
4. Static, thermal, and element deformation loads should have unique identification numbers.   
5. In the superelement solution sequences, if the DEFORM Case Control command is used in a cold start, it must also be specified in the restart.  

Selects the design constraints to be applied at the global level in a design optimization task.  

Format: DESGLB $\scriptstyle\cdot=\mathbf{n}$  

Examples: DESGLB $\scriptstyle=10$ DESG $_{1=25}$  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a set of DCONSTR or a DCONADD Bulk Data entry identification number (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. If used, this command must occur before the first subcase.   
2. The DESGLB Case Control command is optional and invokes constraints that are to be applied independently of a particular subcase. These constraints could be based on responses that are independent of subcases (e.g., WEIGHT, VOLUME, WMPID, FRMASS, and FATIGUE). The DESGLB command must be used when applying constraints to FRMASS, WMPID and FATIGUE responses.   
3. The DESGLB Case Control command can be used to invoke constraints that are not functions of DRESPl entries; e.g., DRESP2 responses that are not functions of DRESPl responses are subcase independent.   
4. Constraints that are applied to responses that span subcases through the use of the DRSPAN command must be invoked using the DESGLB command.  

Assigns the design model parameter used to locate the associated datablocks for merging of two or more SOL 200 models using the MultiOpt application.  

Format: DESMOD $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ name  

Examples: DESMOD $\L=$ FLUTTER   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Name</td><td>Meaning User-specified name to designate the model. (up to 8 characters)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The name is an atribute of the datablocks that require merging across models in order to perform a simultaneous design.   
2. The parameter is only used with MultiOpt, that merges simultaneous models.   
3. A unique value of DESMOD is needed for each model invoked by MultiOpt.   
4.If DESMOD is used in a SOL 200 input file that is not being used in MultiOpt, it will result in a fatal error.   
5. MultiOpt supports Multi Model Optimization (MMO) and Global Optimization (GO), see Design Sensitivity and Optimization User's Guide  

Selects the DRESP1, DRESP2 or DRESP3 entry to be used as the design objective.  

Format:  

$$

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>MIN</td><td>Specifies that the objective is to be minimized.</td></tr><tr><td>MAX</td><td>Specifies that the objective is to be maximized.</td></tr><tr><td>ｎ</td><td>Set identification number of a DRESP1, DRESP2 or DRESP3 Bulk Data entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. A DESOBJ command is required for a design optimization task and is optional for a sensitivity task. Only one DESOBJ command may appear in a Case Control Section.   
2. The referenced DRESPi entry must define a scalar response (e.g., WEIGHT or VOLUME).   
3.If the DESOBJ command refers to a global response, such as weight, it should appear above the first subcase. If the DESOBJ command refers to a subcase-dependent response such as an element stress, it should appear in that subcase. If it refers to a subcase dependent response but is inserted above the first subcase, it will select the response fromthe first subcase for the objective and ignore the responses in subsequent subcases.   
4. Using DREPS2 with weight factors, SOL200 can support multiple objective optimization.   
5. MSC Nastran MultiOpt utility supports Multi Model Optimization (MMO) and Global Optimization (GO), see Design Sensitivity and Optimization User's Guide  

Selects the design constraints to be used in a design optimization task for the current subcase.  

Format: DESSUB $\scriptstyle\cdot=\mathbf{n}$

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a set of DCONSTR and/or a DCONADD Bulk Data entry identification number (Integer ≥ 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. A DESSUB Case Control command is required for every subcase for which constraints are to be applied.An exception to this is μglobal constraints, which are selected by the DESGLB Case Control command.   
2. All DCONSTR and DCONADD Bulk Data entries with the selected set ID will be used.   
3. Constraints cannot be applied to the FRMASS,FATIGUE, or FRFTG response using the DESSSUB command. Use the DESGLB command instead.  

Selects a set of DESVAR entries for the design set to be used

Remarks:  

1. The defaults for SORT1 and SORT2 depend on the type of analysis:  

a. SORTl is the default in static analysis,frequency response,steady state heat transfer analysis, real and complex eigenvalue analysis, flutter analysis, and buckling analysis.   
b. SORT2 is the default in transient response analysis (structural and heat transfer).SORT2 is not available for real eigenvalue (including buckling), complex eigenvalue, or flutter analysis. If SORT1 is selected in a transient solution for one or more of the commands ACCE, DISP, ENTH, FORC, HDOT, MPCF, OLOA, SPCF, STRA, STRE, and VELO, then the remaining  

commands will also be output in SORT1 format. If SORT2 is selected in a static or frequency response solution for one or more of the commands ACCE, DISP, FORC, MPCF, OLOA, SPCF, STRA, STRE, and VELO, then the remaining commands will also be output in SORT2 format.  

c. XY plot requests forces SORT2 and overrides SORT1 requests! d. Ifa RANDOM request occurs the output willbe in SORT2 format, even if SORT1 is requested.  

2. VECTOR and PRESSURE are alternate forms and are equivalent to DISPLACEMENT. In complex analysis, the pressure is ALWAYS magnitude-phase.   
3． DISPLACEMENT $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ NONE overrides an overall output request.   
4.The units of translation are the same as the units oflength of the model. Rotations are in units of radians.   
5. Displacement results are output in the global coordinate system (see field CD on the GRID Bulk Data entry).   
6. The option of PSDF, ATOC, CRMS, and RALL, or any combination of them, can be selected for random analysis. Here PSDF, ATOC and CRMS output is always in SORT2 format.   
7. Note that the CID keyword affects only grid point related output, such as DISPlacement, VELOcity, ACCEleration, OLOAD, SPCForce and MPCForce. In addition, CID keyword needs to appear only once in a grid-related output request anywhere in the Case Control Section to turn on the printing algorithm.   
8. Displacement components may be selected to control filtering to reduce the amount of output produced. When magnitudes are selected, the component values are ignored. Only a single positive value for f can be supplied, and comparisons are performed in the global reference frame. Comparisons are performed after the SET intersection is performed against the domain. Selection of this option does not efect the MAXMIN(GRID) operations.Scalar comparisons are performed using the minimum of all supplied values for the filters.  

For complex vectors encountered in frequency response analysis, the magnitudes TM and RM follow a derivation using a deterministic interpretation and are calculated as follows:  

For Grid Points   
TM   
Define $\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{{C1}=\mathrm{T1}r e a l^{**}2+\mathrm{T2}r e a l^{**}2+\mathrm{T3}r e a l^{**}2}}\\ &{\mathrm{{C2}=\mathrm{T1}i m a g^{**}2+\mathrm{T2}i m a g^{**}2+\mathrm{T3}i m a g^{**}2}}\\ &{\mathrm{{C3}=\mathrm{T1}r e a l^{*}T l i m a g+\mathrm{T2}r e a l^{*}T2i m a g+\mathrm{T3}r e a l^{*}T}}\\ &{\mathrm{{C4}=(C1+C2)/2}}\\ &{\mathrm{{C5}=(C1-C2)/2}}\end{array}$ 3imag   
Then,  

$$
\mathrm{TM}=\mathrm{C}4+\mathrm{SQRT}\left(\mathrm{C}5^{**}2+\mathrm{C}3^{**}2\right)
$$  

The calculations are similar to the above, except that R1, R2 and R3 are used in place of T1, T2 and T3, respectively.  

For Scalar Points  

In this case, TM and RM have the same meaning.   
Define $\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathbf{C}1=\mathrm{T}1\mathrm{rea}^{\mathrm{7}\ast\mathrm{*2}}}\\ &{\mathbf{C}2=\mathrm{T}1\mathrm{im}\mathbf{a}\mathbf{g}^{\mathrm{**}}2}\\ &{\mathbf{C}3=\mathrm{T}1\mathrm{rea}^{\mathrm{1}\ast\mathrm{T}1\mathrm{imag}}}\\ &{\mathbf{C}4=(\mathrm{C}1+\mathrm{C}2)/2}\\ &{\mathbf{C}5=(\mathrm{C}1-\mathrm{C}2)/2}\end{array}$  

Then,  

$$
\mathrm{TM}\ (\mathrm{or\RM})=\mathrm{C}4+\mathrm{SQRT}\ (\mathrm{C}5^{**}2+\mathrm{C}3^{**}2)
$$  

9.When using filters, the compound usage of the verbs PRINT, PLOT is allowed. The entries in the printed output are the entries that exceed any threshold, while the remaining entries within the SET are marked as plot to allow for postprocessing operations. When SORT2 is selected, then PRINT, PLOT must be used to allow for table transpose operations to occur. When any entry in the SORT2 format is above the threshold, all values for time or frequency will be printed for the grid point.  

10. Default eigenvector output format of coupled mode computation (SOL 103) is structure displacement and fluid pressure combined in one datablock per same modes DISP(PRINT) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ AL]  

The eigenvector table has normal title in f06 file.  

# REAL EIGENVECTOR NO．1  

To get structure displacement and fluid pressure separately from coupled mode computation (with METHOD(coupled) in SOL 103), DISP(PRINT,STRUCTURE) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL is used for STRUCTURAL displacement only. The eigenvector table has title (STRUCTURE) in fO6 file.  

REAL EIGENVECTOR（STRUCTURE） NO．1 DISP(PRINT,FLUID) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL is used for FLUID pressure only. The eigenvector table has the title (FLUID)in f06 file.  

REAL EIGENVECTOR（FLUID） NO．1  

DISP(PRINT,BOTH) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL is used for both STRUCTURAL displacement and FLUID pressure but separately. Each eigenvector table includes its own title (STRUCTURE) or (FLUID) in f06 file

Selects the divergence parameters in a static aeroelastic divergence problem  

Format: DIVERG $\mathtt{\Omega}=\mathtt{n}$  

Example: DIVERG $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\mu}_{\mathrm{{J}}}=70$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Meaning Set identification of a DIVERG Bulk Data entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remark:  

1. Static aeroelastic divergence analysis can be performed only in SOLs 144, 200 and 400.  

Selects a dynamic load or an acoustic source to be applied in a transient or frequency response problem.  

Format: DLOAD $\mathtt{\Gamma}=\mathtt{n}$  

Example: DLOAD $^{\dag}=73$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a DLOAD, RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1, TLOAD2, or ACSRCE Bulk Data entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. RLOAD1 and RLOAD2 may only be selected in a frequency response problem.   
2. TLOAD1 and TLOAD2 may be selected in a transient or frequency response problem.   
3. Either an RLOADi or TLOADi entry (but not both) must be selected in an aeroelastic response problem. If RLOADi is selected, a frequency response is calculated. If TLOADi is selected, the transint response is computed by Fourier transform. When there are only gust loads (GUST Bulk Data entry), the DLOAD selects a TLOADi or RLOADi Bulk Data entry with zero load, along with field 3 of the GUST command.   
4.The DLOAD command will be ignored if specified for upstream superelements in dynamic analysis To apply loads to upstream superelements, refer to the LOADSET Case Control command.   
5. For nonlinear dynamic analysis with SOL 40O, TEMPERATURE load can't be applied by DLOAD/TEMP/TLOADi. TEMP (case control) and TTEMP (Bulk data) should be used to apply the temperature load. However, for pure linear analysis, DLOAD/TEMP has to be used for temperature load.  

Select a set of DRESPl entries for the current subcase that are to be used ina DRESP2 or DRESP3 response that spans subcases.  

Format: DRSPAN $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{n}$  

Example: DRSPAN $=10$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a previously appearing SET command (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. In SOL 200, DRESP2 or DRESP3 Bulk Data entries can invoke DRESPl responses that span subcases if these DRESP1 responses have been identified using a DRSPAN Case Control command that references a SET request that identifies the DRESP1 Bulk Data entries.   
2. Each DRESP1 identified must produce a scalar value.   
3. The DRSPAN Case Control command must be at the subcase level, whereas the SET request can be specified above the subcase level.   
4. DRESP2,or DRESP3 that SPANS subcases,cannot reference another DRESP2 and/or DRESP3.   
5. DRSPAN must appear in every subcase in the file if the synthetic response is to span the subcases. The synthetic response via DRESP2 or DRESP3 must reference all DRESP1 IDs defined in SETs of DRSPAN. In DEQATN, all DRESP1 IDs should show up in the list of variables.For those DRESP1 IDs that are not needed, it can be dropped from the definition of equation(s).   
6. To check the value ofspanned response, set parameter P2 of DOPTPRM to a value equal to or larger then 8, see DOPTPRM for details. Note that verification requires performing hand calculation based on user-provided DEQATN for the spanned response.

# Remarks:  

1. Only one DSAPRT may appear in the Case Control Section and it must occur with or above the first SUBCASE command.   
2. Sensitivity data will be output at design cycles i, i+j, i+2j, .., k. Note that the ${\mathrm{BY}}{=}0$ implies no sensitivity results will be output at the intermediate design cycles.   
3.END $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ SENS requests design sensitivity analysis, and no optimization will be performed.   
4. If both DSAPRT and PARAM,OPTEXIT, 4,-4, or 7 are specified, then DSAPRT overrides PARAM,OPTEXIT, 4, -4, or 7. PARAM,OPTEXIT values and the equivalent DSAPRT commands are described as follows:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>OPTEXIT</td><td>EquivalentDSAPRT Command</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>DSAPRT(UNFORMATTED,END=SENS)</td></tr><tr><td>-4</td><td>DSAPRT(NOPRINT,EXPORT,END=SENS</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>DSAPRT(UNFORMATTED, START=LAST)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

5. The n and NONE options are not supported for UNFORMATTED output. Only the UNFORMATTED option is supported for EXPORT.  

6. PARAM,DSZERO can be used to set a threshold for the absolute value of the formatted sensitivity prints.   
7. Design Sensitivity analysis is never performed following a discrete design optimization. Therefore, no sensitivity output will be produced with DSAPRT(END $\c=$ LAST) when discrete optimization is performed at the end of a job.   
8. Formatted sensitivity data can also be written into Comma Separated Values(or CSV) file with following steps a. DSAPRT(formatted..) request in case control. Note that 'formatted' is a default option. b. PARAM,XYUNIT,52 in bulk data. Unit 52 is simply chosen as an example. c. file assignment statement, such as

ECHO $\O=$ BOTH  
ECHO $\c=$ PUNCH， SORT (MAT1， PARAM)  
ECHO $\O=$ SORT(EXCEPT DMI， DMIG)  
ECHO $\c=$ BOTH,PUNCH,FILE  

(In the above examples SeeRemark7.: the PUNCH keyword willalways result in the PUNCH file containing the entirebulk data input.Explicit inclusion indicators (CDNI) such as (MAT1, PARAM)willalways cause a F06 file to be written that contains only the (CDNI) data.)  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td> Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>SORT</td><td>The sorted (arranged in alphanumeric order) Bulk Data will be printed.</td></tr><tr><td>EXCEPT</td><td>Excludes cdni Bulk Data entries from sorted echo printout.

# Remarks:  

1. If no ECHO command appears, sorted Bulk Data willbe printed.   
2. Comments will appear at the front of the sorted file if ECHO $\mid=$ PUNCH.   
3. Portions of the unsorted Bulk Data can be selectively echoed by including the commands ECHOON and ECHOOFF at various places within the Bulk Data.ECHOOFF stops the unsorted echo until an ECHOON commands is encountered. Many such pairs of commands may be used. The ECHOON and ECHOOFF command may be used in the Executive and Case Control Sections; however, ECHOOFF should not be the first entry and continuation entries are not handled correctly.   
4.If the SORT (cdni...) describer is specified in a restart in SOLs 101 through 200, then the continuation entries will not be printed.   
5.If the SORT (cdni...) describer is used, then it must appear as the last describer, as in the preceding example.   
6.If the EXCEPT describer is specified, then it must be specified before allcdni. AllBulk Data entry types willbelisted except those given for cdn1,cdn2, etc.IfEXCEPT is not specified, then only those Bulk Data entry types listed under cdnl, cdn2, etc. will be listed.   
7. PUNCH without options or PUNCH(SORT) produces a sorted listing of the entire bulk data input in the punch file. PUNCH(NEWBULK) produces unsorted bulk data input with updated design model entries in the punch file. PUNCH(BOTH) combines these two outputs.

Remarks:  

1. The ELSUM Case Control command produces a summary of properties for elements. The properties include element ID, material ID,length or thickness, area, volume, structural mass, nonstructural mass, total mass, and the product of total mass \* WTMASS. Total mass is the sum of the structural and nonstructural masses.  

2. Certain element types produce only partial data.For these element types, no mass data is produced, and mass totals will not include any contributions from these element types.Mass data is computed for the following element types: CBAR, CBEAM, CBEND, CHEXA, CMASSi, CONM1, CONM2, CONROD, CPENTA, CQUAD4, CQUAD8, CQUADR, CRAC2D, CRAC3D, CROD, CSHEAR, CTETRA, CTRIA3, CTRIA6, CTRIAR, CTRIAX6, and CTUBE. The mass of elements with mid side nodes is approximated using only the geometry of the corner nodes. To get an accurate total mass, use the output from the Grid Point Weight Generator (PARAM,GRDPNT).   
3. EIDSUM takes precedence over EID if both are present.Likewise, PIDSUM takes precedence over PID.   
4. The ELSUM Case Control command is ignored in heat transfer solution sequences.   
5. The NSMCONT describer produces various amounts of output depending upon whether the summary option is selected (SUMMARY, PIDSUM or EIDSUM requested). If NSMCONT is combined with PID, a table is produced that identifies the contribution of each NSM type Bulk Data entry to the total element nonstructural mass If SUMMARY is included with PID and NSMCONT, an additional table is produced that identifies the mass contributions for each property type by property ID.   
6. ELSUM output is only available for the PRINT option, not the PUNCH or PLOT options used in other commands.   
7. ELSUM does not support advanced nonlinear elements.

Remarks:  

1. The EQUILIBRIUM Case Control command produces a summary of the applied loads, single point forces of constraint (SPC),and multipoint/rigid body element forces of constraint (MPC), as wellas a summation of these quantities. In order for the summation to represent all of the forces in the problem, these forces must be available and, therefore, the specification of an EQUILIBRIUM Case Control command causes the program to automatically compute the SPC and MPC forces. However, if desired, the associated Case Control commands should request output. The single point forces of constraint are requested by the presence of an SPCFORCE command, and the multipoint/RBE constraint forces are requested by an MPCFORCE command. Applied loads are automatically generated by the presence of the LOAD selection Case Control command.  

2. Results are always output in the basic coordinate system.   
3. The EQUILIBRIUM Case Control command is applicable to Linear Static analysis (SOL101) only, and does not produce output if any superelements are present.

Remarks:  

1. ERP is required to produce any ERP output and ERP request must appear either above SUBCASE level or within lst SUBCASE. Subsequent SUBCASEs,from 2nd onwards, may or may not have ERP request.   
2. Output is generated in SORT2 by default. Unlike other Case Control requesting SORT2 format, the ERP command does not force all other output into SORT2 format.   
3. FILTER has no effect on PUNCHed, CSV or OP2 output.   
4.In addition to individual panel output a summary named ALLPANEL is produced. If there are multiple subcases, the panel name is formed from the serial subcase number (l-nsubc) and the characters ‘ALLP' as in ALLPo002 unless the ERP command request output for ALL panels across the Subcases. In this case, the summary panel name ALLPANEL is retained.   
5. Selectable frequencies are dependent on the presence of an OFREQ Case Control command.   
6. ERPRHO, ERPC, ERPRLF, RHOCP, and ERPREFDB are actually PARAM,name,value entries.   
7.The filter processavoids printing ERP for cases where ERP/ERPMAX is less than the FILTER value. ERPMAX is the maximum ERP value across allfrequencies for a panel.   
8.If output to a .csv file is requested, the file must be assigned with logical key USERFILE and FORM $\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}=\mathbf{\Pi}$ FORMATTED, e.g., ASSIGN USERFILE $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ myfile.csv UNIT $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=50$ FORM $\mathop{\left.\sum}\right.$ FORMATTED STATUS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NEW   
9.The MPF of ERP willbe computed with the same parameters, such as SOLUTION, csv, setp and etc.   
10. MPFs for ERP are sorted by increasing order of natural frequencies unless the MPFSORT keyword specifies adiffrent sorting order.Ifa sorting order is specified, the KEY keyword selects the item that is used for sorting. Since ERP is always positive, ABSA/ALGA and ABSD/ALGD willproduce same sorting results.  

11. Element ERP includes elements defined via ERPPNL and SET3. For 3D element types, such as HEXA, PENTA and TETRA, element ERP includes those elements at the outer surface ofthe model. For an element with multiple faces exposed, the element ERP is the summation of ERP of all exposed faces.  

12. MPF for ERP and element ERP may increases the volume of output significantly

Remarks:  

1. If $\mathrm{THRESH}=\mathrm{p}$ is not specified, then p defaults to the values specified by user parameter TINY.   
2. The energy calculations include the contribution of initial thermal strain.   
3.Energy density (element strain energy divided by element volume) is also computed in some solutior sequences. It can be suppressed by use of PARAM,EST,-1.   
4.For frequency response analysis, the energy may becomputed inone of three ways as selected by AVERAGE:  

$$

$$  

PEAK:  

$$
E_{p e a k}=E_{o}+E_{a}
$$  

where:  

$$
\begin{array}{r c l}{{\mathrm{E}}}&{{=}}&{{\mathrm{elemental\energy.}}}\\ {{\{u_{r}\}}}&{{=}}&{{\mathrm{displacement\(real\part).}}}\\ {{\{u_{i}\}}}&{{=}}&{{\mathrm{displacement\(imaginary\part).}}}\\ {{\{K_{e}\}}}&{{=}}&{{\mathrm{elemental\stiffness.}}}\end{array}
$$  

5. In SOLs 111 and 112, ESE is not available if both PARAM,DDRMM,0 and PARAM,SPARSEDR,NO are specified.   
6. Element data recovery for thermal loads is not currently implemented in dynamics.   
7. Element strain energy is available for nonlinear static analysis (SOL 106). However, in a normal modes analysis in SOL 106 with PARAM,NMLOOP (or ANALYSIS $\O=$ MODES) or a PARAM NMLOOP restart into SOL 103,energies are computed for elements with linear properties only. All other nonlinear solution sequences do not support element strain energy output.  

8.The strain energy for nonlinear elements is calculated by integrating the specific energy rate, the inner product of strain rate, and stress over element volume and time.  

$$
E=\int\int_{0}^{t}\int_{}^{t}\upsigma d V d\uptau
$$  

where:  

a = stress tensor ·ε $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ tensor of the strain rate $\begin{array}{r l}{V}&{{}=}\end{array}$ element volume $\begin{array}{r l}{t}&{{}=}\end{array}$ actual time in the load history  

Loads from temperature changes are included in Eq.(5-10). If we assume a linear variation of temperatures from subcase to subcase,then the strain energy in Eq.(5-10)for the special case of linear material and geometry becomes  

$$
E=\frac{1}{2}{u}^{T}K_{e}u-\frac{1}{2}{u}^{T}P_{e t}
$$  

where $P_{e t}$ is the element load vector for temperature differences.  

For linear elements, the default definition of element strain energy is  

$$
E=\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{u}^{T}K_{e}\boldsymbol{u}-\boldsymbol{u}^{T}P_{e t}
$$  

where $P_{e t}$ is the element load vector for temperature differences and element deformation.  

In Eq. 5-12),the temperatures are assumed to be constant within a subcase.The default definition of the strain energy for linear elements differs from the definition for nonlinear elements by a factor of $1/2$ in the temperature loads. To request the strain energy for linear elements using Eq.(5-11), set the parameter XFLAG to 2; the default value for XFLAG is 0, which uses Eq. (5-12)for the strain energy of linear elements.

Remarks:  

1. Each load vector is stored individually as a one column matrix that is qualified by LOADID and LOADNAME. The combination of both the LOADID and the LOADNAME describers should uniquely identify the load vector to avoid overwriting (or possibly triggering the output twice rule an existing load vector).   
2. If placed above the SUBCASE entry, then the load vectors for all subcases are saved.   
3. Theload vectors are qualified by LOADID and LOADNAME for selection using the WHERE clause on FMS commands that support it.   
4.The following table shows the value of the LOADID and LOADNAME describers that are assigned for various EXPORTLD requests:

5. The load vector is typically imported into a run using the FMS DBLOCATE statement. The imported load is referenced by using its LOADID value on a LOAD Case Control command or Bulk Data entry. For example:  

ASSIGN loadsl $\mathbf{\omega}=\mathbf{\vec{\mathbf{\nabla}}}$ runl.MASTER'   
DBLOCATE datablk $\c=$ (EXTLD）WHERE（LOADNAME $\mathbf{\omega}=\mathbf{\vec{\mathbf{\nabla}}}$ ALLCASES'）,

Remarks:  

1. EXTDRIN is intended for step three in external superelement analysis. External superelement data recovery is accomplished by restarting from the data base created in step one (external superelement creation run) and attaching the boundary solution data from step two (assembly run).The boundary solution data must have been stored in step two via the EXTDROUT Case Control command or use! parameter EXTDROUT.   
2. External superelement data recovery restarts are limited to SOLs 101, 103,107 through 112, and 400.   
3. EXTDRIN must be specified above all subcases.   
4. User parameters EXTDR and EXTDRUNT are the old method for requesting an external superelement data recovery restart. EXTDRIN Case Control command takes precedence over the EXTDR and EXTDRUNT user parameters.   
5.If data recovery is desired for the external component in SOLs 101,103,107 through 112 and 400 there are four methods to transmit the displacements of the reduced model, in Step 2, to the externa full model. The method is selected by the EXTDROUT Case Control command in Step 2. The options are as follows:   
a. EXTDROUT(MATRIXDBI $\c=$ dbext]). The displacements of the reduced component model are stored directly on the database. The sequencing of the displacement degrees-of-freedom corresponds to the sequencing in the reduced model. Keyword dbext exports the boundary solution data to a new DBset initialized by the“INIT dbext" statement in the File Management section of the input.   
b. EXTDROUT(DMIGDB $\c=$ dbext]). The displacements of the reduced model are stored on the database in a format which allows automatic connection to the reduced component model if the reduction grid points and scalar points are the same grid points and scalar points used in the analysis model. Keyword dbext exports the boundary solution data to a new DBset initialized by the“INIT dbext" statement in the File Management section of the input.   
c. EXTDROUT(DMIGOP2 $\v{M}_{\cdot}=$ unit). The same as EXTDROUT(DMIGDB) except that the displacements of the reduced model are written in OUTPUT2 format to a tape unit specified by the unit keyword (Default $_{:=31}$ ). The output unit can be assigned to a specific file by using an ASSIGN OUTPUT2 command in the File Management Section.   
d. EXTDROUT(MATOP4 $\mathrel{\mathop:}=$ unit). The same as EXTDROUT(MATRIXDB) except that the displacements of the reduced model are written in OUTPUT4 format to a tape unit specified by the unit keyword (Defaul $_{:=31}$ ). The output unit can be assigned to a specific file by using an ASSIGN OUTPUT4 command in the File Management Section.   
Data recovery restart for the external superelement (Step 3) is available in SOLs 101, 103, 107   
through 112, and 400 and is accomplished by using a restart procedure from the data base created in   
Step 1 and specifying the EXTDRIN Case Control command to import the solutions from Step 2.   
The method on inputting the reduced displacements into the component model depends on the   
method used to output the external component in Step 2. The setups for Steps 2 and 3 are:   
6. For SOL 101, the Step 3 Case Control structure must match the system model subcase structure in the numbers of loading conditions. The loading used in step one to generate the loads transmitted to the analysis model must also be specified in this step. If the analysis model had more loading conditions than the component model, then the loadings defined in Step 1 must be specified first.   
7. For SOLs 103 and 107 through 112, the Step 3 Case Control structure must match the analysis model subcase structure in the number of eigenvalue extractions, FREQ/DLOAD or TSTEP/DLOAD subcases.

8. SOL 40O with multidisciplinary and linear perturbation analyses will produce multiple boundary solutions in Step 2; i.e.,a boundary solution for each SUBCASE with a unique ANALYSIS command. Hence in SOL 400 for Step 3 as soon as the boundary solutions have been imported, a summary of the boundary solutions will be printed in the fO6. Here is a sample:

The“Solution ID" column contains an arbitrary identification number which may be specified on the SOLUTION Case Control command in Step 3 whose usage will be described below. The "Analysis Type",“Subcase",and“Step" columns are the same as the ANALYSIS, SUBCASE, and STEP commands specified on Step 2. The“Superelement" column pertains the external superelement ID processed in Step 2. The “Title/Subtitle/Label" is taken from the TITLE, SUBTITLE, and LABEL commands specified in Step 2.  

In Step 3, as with any restart, the Case Control must contain the same loads and boundary condition (LBC) commands specified in Step 1 like LOAD, SPC, MPC, METHOD, etc. If there is only one subcase specified in Step 3 then, by default, SOL 400 will perform external superelement data recovery for all solutions above. Here is a sample Step 3 Case Control setup:  

EXTDRIN   
$\mathrm{SPC=1}$   
$\mathrm{MPC}=3$   
$\mathtt{I O A D}=5$   
\$   
DISP $\O=$ ALL   
STRESS $\c=$ ALL  

The displacement and element stress request for all solutions listed in the table above will be computed.  

If, however, data recovery is desired at only a few solutions then a SUBCASE and SOLUTION command pair is required to obtain data recovery at each of the desired solutions. The subcases may be specified in any order and the SOLUTION command specifies the desired “Solution ID" from the table above. For example,  

EXTDRIN   
$\mathrm{SPC=1}$   
$\mathrm{MPC}=3$   
SUBCASE 1 SOLUTION $=5$ STRESS $\c=$ ALL   
SUBCASE 2 SOLUTION $\scriptstyle=3$ DISP $\c=$ ALL  

Alternatively, the ANALYSIS command may be used instead of the SOLUTION command. For example,  

EXTDRIN  
$\mathrm{SPC=1}$   
$\mathrm{MPC}=3$   
SUBCASE 1ANALYSIS $\c=$ MFREQSTRESS $\c=$ ALL  
SUBCASE 2ANALYSIS $\c=$ BUCKLE$\scriptstyle\mathrm{DISP=}\mathtt{A L L}$  

If there is more than on solution associated with a particular analysis type, then results will be computed for all“Solution IDs" corresponding to that analysis type.  

9. In Step 2, more than one external superelement may be processed by EXTDROUT. The following must be noted if DMIGOP2 or MATOP4 is used.  

a. In SOLs 101, 103, and 107 through 112, the user must specify separate EXTDROUT as show1 in the example below:  

SUBCASE 1SUPER $\scriptstyle=10$ EXTDROUT(DMIGOP2=45)  
SUBCASE 2SUPER $\scriptstyle=20$ EXTDROUT( $\cdot\mathrm{DMIGOP}2{=}46)$  

b. In SOL 400, the user may specify separate EXTDROUT as described above or the same EXTDROUT command for all external superelements. If the user specifies the same EXTDROUT, then in the 3rd step a fatal message will be issued as shown below:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="7">Assembly Run Solutions</td></tr><tr><td>Solution ID</td><td>Analysis</td><td></td><td></td><td>Super-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>type</td><td>Subcase</td><td>Step</td><td>element</td><td>Title/subtitle/Label</td></tr><tr><td>１</td><td>MODES</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>MODAL， 3-STEP EXTERNAL SE，DMIGDB，ASSEMBLY</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>MODES</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>MODAL， 3-STEP EXTERNAL SE，DMIGDB，ASSEMBLY</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

\*\*\* USER FATAL MESSAGE 229O7 (EXTDRSUM)  

The attached boundary solutions %l contains solutions for more than one external superelement   
and the desired superelement ID has not been selected.   
USER ACTION: If the EXTDROUT Case Control command (or PARAM,EXTDROUT) specified DMIGOP2 or MATOP4 then you must specify the superelement ID on the SUPER Case Control command to select the appropriate boundary solution. If EXTDROUT Case Control command (or PARAM,EXTDROUT） specified MATRIXDB or DMIGDB then you must specify the superelement ID. a) On the SUPER Case Control command to select the appropiate boundary solution. or b） In the WHERE(SEII $\scriptstyle)=$ superelement_ID) clause on the DBLoCATE statement of the boundary solutions database to select the appropiate boundary solution.  

The summary shows that the solution file contains solutions for superelements 10 and 20 and the message indicates that only one solution may be processed. So the user must specify the SUPER command to select the desired superelement; e.g.,  

SUPER $\scriptstyle=1$ 0   
EXTDRIN(DMIGOP2=45)   
Alternatively for EXTDRIN(DMIGDB or MATRIXDB) only, the user may specify WHERE(SEID $_{=10}$ ) on the DBLOCATE statement of the boundary solution database.

Remarks:  

1. EXTDROUT is intended for step two (or assembly run) in external superelement analysis.   
2. EXTDROUT is honored in SOLs 101, 103, 107 through 112, and 400 only.  

3.In SOLs 101,103, and 107 through 112, if there are multiple external superelements and DMIGOP2 or MATOP4 is requested then EXTDROUT must be specified in separate subcases for each external superelement along with the SUPER command and unitop4 or unitop2 must be unique for each external superelement. Separate EXTDROUT commands are not required in SOL 400. See Remarks 9. and 10. under the EXTDRIN Case Control command description.   
4. User parameters EXTDROUT and EXTDRUNT are the old method for requesting the storage of boundary solution data. EXTDROUT Case Control command takes precedence over the EXTDROUT and EXTDRUNT user parameters.   
5. See EXTDRIN's case control command description for a description of EXTDROUT and EXTDRIN usage.

Remarks:  

1. If none of the describers STIFFNESS through FSCOUP is specified, then all matrices are stored.   
2. STIFFNESS and DAMPING may be abbreviated to STIF and DAMP,respectively.  

3.EXTID with an seid value must be specified if one or more of ASMBULK, EXTBULK, DMIGPCH, or MATOP4 are specified.  

If the DMIGSFIX $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ EXTID form is employed along with the DMIGPCH specification, the value seid may not exceed 999999 since this value becomes part of the names given to the DMIG matrices generated on the standard punch file (.pch). See Remark 13., and Example 3 in Remark 18.  

If PARAM,AUTOQSET,YES is specified to used generate the Q-set degrees of freedom (DOFs) (generalized coordinates),the value seid may not exceed 999 since this value becomes part of the automatically generated IDs of the SPOINTs representing the Q-set DOFs. See explanation in Item c under Remark 17.  

4.If ASMBULK is specified, the folowing Bulk Data entries are generated and stored on the assembly punch file (.asm):

6.If ASMBULK $.=\mathsf{A}$ UTO is specified, the following Bulk Data entries are generated and stored on the assembly punch file (.asm):  

SEBULK seid (specifies AuTO as the method for searching   
boundary points)   
SECONCT seid (defines connections for boundary scalar   
points)  

GRID entries for access grid points CORD2x entries associated with the access grid points SPOINT entries for boundary and access scalar points  

7. If DMIGPCH or MATOP4 is specified, then EXTBULK need not be specified. Also, the model cannot have rotors (ROTOR, ROTORG, ROTORSE, and ROTORAX Bulk Data entries).  

8. If DMIGPCH is not specified, but EXTBULK or MATOP4 is specified, the following Bulk Data entries are generated and stored on the standard punch file (.pch):  

BEGIN BULK seid   
GRID entries for boundary points   
GRID entries for interior points referenced by PLoTEL entries   
SPOINT entries for boundary scalar points as well as for Q-set   
points

CORD2x entries associated with the boundary GRID entries   
ASET/ASET1   
PLOTEL entries referencing the boundary GRID entries   
DMIG entries for the requested boundary matrices  

10. The DMIGSFIX keyword is ignored if DMIGPCH is not specified.  

11. If DMIGPCH is specified without the DMIGSFIX keyword, then the boundary DMIG matrices generated and stored on the standard punch file (.pch) will have names of the following form:  

KAAX (boundary stiffness matrix)   
MAAX (boundary mass matrix)   
BAAX (boundary viscous damping matrix)   
K4AAx (boundary structural damping matrix)   
PAX (boundary load matrix)   
AAX (boundary fluid-structure coupling matrix)  

See Example 3 in Remark 18  

12. If the DMIGSFIX $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ cccccc form is employed along with the DMIGPCH specification, then the boundary DMIG matrices generated and stored on the standard punch file (.pch) willhave names of the following form:  

Kcccccc (boundary stiffness matrix)   
Mcccccc (boundary mass matrix)   
Bcccccc (boundary viscous damping matrix)   
K4cccccc (boundary structural damping matrix)   
Pcccccc (boundary load matrix)   
Acccccc (boundary fluid-structure coupling matrix)  

See Example 3 in Remark 18.  

13． If the DMIGSFIX $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ EXTID form is employed along with the DMIGPCH specification, then the boundary DMIG matrices generated and stored on the standard punch file (.pch) will have names of the following form:  

Kseid (boundary stiffness matrix) Mseid (boundary mass matrix) Bseid (boundary viscous damping matrix) K4seid (boundary structural damping matrix)  

Pseid (boundary load matrix) Aseid (boundary fluid-structure coupling matrix) where seid is the superelement ID specified by the EXTID keyword.  

See Example 3 in Remark 18.  

14. If the DMIGPCH option is specified, the boundary DMIG matrices generated and stored on the standard punch file (.pch) may not be as accurate as the boundary matrices resulting from the other options (MATDB/MATRIXDB, or DMIGOP2 ,or MATOP4). Accordingly, this may result in decreased accuracy from the subsequent assembly job using these DMIG matrices.  

15. The punch output resulting from EXTSEOUT usage is determined by ASMBULK, EXTBULK, DMIGPCH, and MATOP4 as follows:  

No ASMBULK,EXTBULK,DMIGPCH or MATOP4 No punch output.  

ASMBULK, but no EXTBULK, or DMIGPCH, or MATOP4  

Punch output is generated and stored on the assembly punch file (.asm) as indicated in Remarks 4 through 6.  

No ASMBULK, but EXTBULK,DMIGPCH, or MATOP4  

Punch output is generated and stored on the standard punch file (.pch) as indicated in Remarks 8. or 9. (as appropriate).  

ASMBULK and EXTBULK, DMIGPCH or MATOP4  

Punch output consists of two distinct and separate parts. One part is generated and stored on the assembly punch file (.asm) as indicated in Remarks 4. through 6. The other part is generated and stored on the standard punch file (.pch) as indicated in Remarks 8. or 9. (as appropriate).  

16.IfDMIGOP2 $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ unitop2 or MATOP4 $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ unitop4 is specified, an appropriate ASSIGN OUTPUT2 or ASSIGN OUTPUT4 statement must be present in the File Management Section (FMS) for the specified Fortran unit numbers. See Examples 2 and 4 in Remark 18.  

17. The creation of an external superelement using EXTSEOUT involves running a Nastran job, with the following additional data:  

a. The data for the creation of the external superelement is specified by the EXTSEOUT Case Control command. It is best to specify this command above the subcase level. However, if the Nastran job itself involves superelements, then the EXTSEOUT command may also be specified within the subcase that is applicable to the residual.   
b. The boundary points of the external superelement are specified by ASET/ASET1 Bulk Data entries.   
c.If the external superelement creation involves component mode reduction, then Q-set degrees of freedom (DOFs) (generalized coordinates) must be defined. This can be done either by automatically defining them via PARAM,AUTOQSET,YES or by explicitly specifying them via QSET/QSET1 Bulk Data entries. Note that for the latter case of explicit definition, only SPOINTs may be specified as Q-set points; no grid points may be specified. If this requirement is not met, the program terminates the execution with an appropriate fatal message.  

If PARAM,AUTOQSET,YES is specified, SPOINTs are automatically generated internally to represent the Q-set DOFs. The IDs of these SPOINTs are of the form 9sssnnnn where sss is the superelement ID seid specified by the EXTID keyword, and nnnn is a mode number. Both sss and nnnn will have leading zeros inserted in them to ensure that sssis a three-digit number and nnnn is a four-digit number. Thus, for example, the Q-set DOF corresponding to the $8^{\mathrm{th}}$ mode of superelement ID 5 would be represented by an SPOINT with an automatically generated ID of 90050008, while the Q-set DOF corresponding to the $50^{\mathrm{{th}}}$ mode of superelement ID 25 would be represented by an SPOINT with an automatically generated ID of 90250050.  

Because of the preceding numbering scheme, the superelement ID seid specified by the EXTID keyword must necessarily not exceed 999 when PARAM,AUTOQSET,YES is specified. The program terminates the job with a User Fatal Message if this condition is not met.  

Further, because of the preceding numbering scheme, the user should ensure that, when PARAM,AUTOQSET,YES is specified, the IDs of the grid and scalar points of the external superelement do not conflict with the automatically generated SPOINT IDs of the Q-set DOFs. The program terminates the job with a User Fatal Message if this condition is not met.  

d. The fixity of the boundary DOFs for the component mode reduction may be specified using the BSETi/BNDFIXi and CSETi/BNDFREE/BNDFRE1 Bulk Data entries.(The default scenario assumes that all boundary DOFs are fixed for component mode reduction.)  

e.The output for the external superelement is generated in the assembly job.This output consists of displacements, velocities, accelerations, SPC forces, MPC forces and element stresses, strains and forces. However, in order for this output to be generated in the assembly job, the output requests must be specified in the external superelement creation run. Normally, the only output requests for the external superelement that are honored in the assembly job are those that are specified in the creation run. There is, however, one important exception to this: the output for the boundary and access grid and scalar points, as well as for all grid points associated with PLOTEL entries,can be obtained in the assembly job even if there is no output request specified for these points in the creation run.  

If the creation run contains the load requests TEMPERATURE (LOAD) or DEFORM, then element stresses and element forces will not be available in the assembly run.  

f.If the assembly job involves the use of PARAM Bulk Data entries,then the folowing points should be noted:   
·PARAM entries specified in the main bulk data portion of the input data apply only to the residual and not to the external superelements.   
· PARAM entries specified in the BEGIN SUPER portion of the Bulk Data for an external superelement apply only to that superelement.   
The most convenient way of ensuring that PARAM entries apply not only to the residual, but also to all external superelements, is to specify such PARAM entries in the Case Control Section, not in the main bulk data. This is particularly relevant for PARAMs such as POST.  

18.The following examples illustrate details of job setups for the external superelement creation and the subsequent assembly process for various scenarios. These examples assume that there are three external superelement creation jobs, one each for external SE 10 (extsel0.dat), SE 20 (extse20.dat) and SE 30 (extse30.dat), followed by an assembly job.

19. If EXTBULK is specified, then METADATA entries will be copied to the .pch file.  

0. Data recovery for the external superelement is possble via two methods: two-step and three-step.  

a. In the two-step method, EXTSEOUT automatically generates output transformation matrices (OTMs) based on STRESS, FORCE, DISPLACEMENT, SPCFORCE, MPCFORCE, and STRAIN Case Control commands specified in the first (creation) run. Then in the second (assembly) run, data recovery is performed on the external superelement. If Modules are present in the first run, then OTMs are generated for those grid points and elements in Module O only.   
b. The three-step method requires a restart of the first run to perform data recovery on the external superelement. The method is explained in the description of the EXTDRIN Case Control command.If Modules are present in the first run, this method allows for data recovery in any Module.   
c. Both methods are described in more detail in the MSC Nastran Superelements amd Modules User's Guide.  

d. For dynamicaly reduced external superelements, the displacement OTMs created with dynamic reduction include both the dynamic effects of the o-set and also the fixed boundary effects of the o-set due to interiorloads. With the two-step method, only one of these effects should be included in a SOL 101, 106 and 400 (with ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ STATICS) assembly. Therefore, if there are interior loads in the external superelement and the two-step method is being used, attaching the dynamically reduced external superelements in a static analysis of the assembly is not recommended.

# Remarks:  

1. A single FATIGUE case control is required to perform one (SOL 108/111) or more (SOL 101/103/112) fatigue analyses and must be present above the SUBCASE level. If not present, no fatigue analysis will occur regardless of the presence of other bulk data related to fatigue analysis.  

2. It is not necessary to include any case control STRESS and/or STRAIN output requests in order for the FATIGUE output request to obtain the necessary stresses or strains for the fatigue calculation.  

3. For a single fatigue analysis, ${\mathrm{BULK}}{=}{\mathrm{n}}$ points to a FTGDEF, a FTGPARM, and a FTGSEQ (or FTGLOAD) entry, each with $\mathrm{ID}{=}\mathbf{n}$  

4. For multiple fatigue analyses, $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{ET=n} Ḍ$ points to a previously appearing SET case control and each member of the SET is the ID of a FTGDEF, a FTGPARM, and a FTGSEQ (or FTGLOAD) bulk data entry with that ID (SOL 101, 103, or 112 only).  

5.A fatigue analysis must have, at a minimum,loading and material data defined on either FTGSEQ or FTGLOAD and MATFTG bulk data entries, respectively, for a fatigue analysis to be valid. FTGPARM and FTGDEF entries can be absent, in which case, defaults will be used.  

6. The following additional, optional, fatigue output file formats may be requested. The given codes must be summed if multiple files are requested. Example: CSV file and FEF file CODE would be $64+128=192$ . Note the following:  

SOL 101, 103, or 112: For multi-layered results,such as shells that compute top and bottom results, a separate file for each is generated for HYP, UNV, and FEF formats with _top or bottom designations in the name.If only a single file with worst case layer results is desired, add 256 or 10,000 to the CODE. Using the above example would give 448 or 10192. Either mechanism works. Note that CSV and FER file output only ever creates a single file as both layers are reported in the single file, but adding 256 or 10,00 writes only the worst case layer result.  

· SOL 108, or 1ll: For multi-layered results, such as shels that compute top and bottom results, a separate file for each is generated for FEF formats with the following designations in the name: _Nor_E(for element nodal or element center, respectively),_W or $\_^{\mathrm{~T~}}$ or_B (for worst layer, top layer or bottom layer, respectively or _EVi (for event i, or _EVs for summary only.  

Some output is not available for duty cycle jobs if EVNTOUT $\mathrm{\bar{\it{>}}}0$ on the FTGSEQ bulk data entry. Check messages if the $\mathbf{f}06$ and log files if the requested output files are not being generated.

\* For random vibration fatigue using SOLs 108 or 111, the CSV file output request is also dependent on the LOGLVL field setting on the FTGPARM entry. By default a <jid>PSD.csv file is always generated, which at a minimum contains the input PSD, stress transfer function (TF) and result PSD for the critical entity.  

tSOL 101, 103, 112 produce FEF files of type PATRAN 2 els or PATRAN 2 nod' with .fef extension; SOL 108, 11l produce FEF files of type‘PATRAN 2 els' with .els_fef extension. Also see Remark 11.  

7. RESTARTs are possible with FATIGUE output request aslong as the stress/strain state of the entities requested does not change. Most parameters on the FTGPARM (LOC excluded as it requires a different set of stresses/strains) can be changed on a RESTART. Different loading (FTGSEQ) and materials (MATFTG) can also be investigated using the RESTART capability (SOLs 101, 103, & 112 only).  

8. Standard fatigue output is:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stress-Life (SN) Analysis</td><td>Strain-Life (eN) Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>LIFE (Repeats*)</td><td>LIFE (Repeats)</td></tr><tr><td>LOG of LIFE (Repeats)</td><td>LOG of LIFE (Repeats)</td></tr><tr><td>LIFE (user units)</td><td>LIFE (user units)</td></tr><tr><td> LOG of LIFE (user units)</td><td>LOG of LIFE (user units)</td></tr><tr><td>DAMAGE</td><td>DAMAGE</td></tr><tr><td>LOG of DAMAGE</td><td>LOG of DAMAGE</td></tr><tr><td>MAX STRESS</td><td>MAX STRESS or STRAIN **</td></tr><tr><td>MIN STRESS</td><td>MIN STRESS or STRAIN</td></tr></table></body></html>  

${}^{*}\mathrm{Or}$ Seconds for SOL 108 and SOL 111  

tUser units are fatigue equivalent units as defined on the FTGSEQ or FTGLOAD entry and other output is available depending on the settings of the FTGPARM entry. Please see those entries for more detail.  

\$For SOLs 108 and 111 Maximum Stress $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ Mean Stress $^+$ MAXPEAK\*RMS Stress, Minimum Stress $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ Mean Stress - MAXPEAK\*RMS Stress. MAXPEAK is defined on FTGPARM entry and is defaulted to 3.0.  

\*\*Depends on FTGPARM line used: STRESS or STRAIN.  

9. STATICS, FREQ, DFREQ, MFREQ options are utilized in SOL 20O only.Fatigue and design sensitivity analysis willbe performed for the designated analysis type only.If STATICS is specified (default), FATIGUE case control must be associated with subcases containing ANALYSIS $\scriptstyle=,$ STATIC for a pseudo-static fatigue analysis and the fatigue DRESPl responses/constraints specified must be of RTYPE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ FATIGUE. If one of FREQ, DFREQ, MFREQ is specified, FATIGUE case control must be associated with subcases containing ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ MFREQ or DFREQ for random vibration fatigue analysis and the fatigue DRESP1 response/constraints specified must be of RTYPE $\v{x}_{1}=$ FRFTG.  

10. For SOL 108/111 with FATIGUE analysis, PARAM,SPARSEDR,no and PARAM,DDRMM,-1 both must be present. Otherwise, FATIGUE analysis willbe skipped. Or, PARAM,SPARSEDR,yes, which is default, can be used instead.  

11. The FEF file output request produces PATRAN 2 stye elemental or nodal ASCII results files that can be imported directly into Patran for post processing. In order to import these files into Patran a template file is also required in order to tell Patran how to map the columns of data in the files to proper, meaningful labels. The analysis job produces both the FEF file and the corresponding template files.For SOLs 101, 103,and 112, the template file has the extension .tml with the same base name as the FEF file. For SOLs 108 and 111, the template file is called $<j\ i\ d>$ .res_tmpl, where $<j\ i\ d>$ is the job name. Jobs run with LOC $\dot{\mathbf{\Omega}}=\mathbf{\Omega}$ ELEM or NODE on the FTGPARM entry create elemental based FEF files or all SOL sequences. Jobs run with LOC $\dot{\mathbf{\Omega}}=\mathbf{\Omega}$ NODA produce nodal based FEF files for SOLs 101,103, and 112 and produce elemental based FEF files for SOLs 108 and 111. In Patran these files are imported under the FilelImport menu with the Object set to Results and the Format set to either PATRAN 2 els...or PATRAN 2 nod...for elemental or nodal based FEF results files, respectively. The Element Node Results switch must be set to Connectivity Based for proper import of elemental based results.  

You may use the job produced template files to import the FEF files or you may use standard template files provided with the Patran installation. The advantage of using the standard template files is that you may select them directly from the list without navigating the file browser to the location of the job produced template files. The disadvantage is that these files use more generic labels. The job produced template files use labels that indicate the stress units and actual defined equivalent fatigue units as defined by the job. When using the standard template files you must know which template file to select based on the table below.

12.When a FATIGUE case control is present to perform random vibration fatigue analysis using SOLs 108 and 11l, only one FREQUENCY case control set is allowed for all transfer function SUBCASEs and should be above the SUBCASE level or only present in lst SUBCASE.The FREQUENCY set cannot change from SUBCASE to SUBCASE or a fatal error is issued.  

13. SOL 101, 103, or 112 only: The following additional, optional, stress or stain output may be requested. The given codes must be summed if multiple requests are required. Example: CODE would be $1+2=3$ for fatigue stress and maximum stress range vector results. The presence of this output request overrides the STROUT entry on the FTGPARM entry. If PLOT is specified in the FATIGUE case control, no output is printed and only available in the OUTPUT2 or HDF5 files.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Additional Stress/Strain Output</td><td>CODE</td></tr><tr><td>No additional output</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fatigue Stress/Strain - these are the physical (or modal) stress/strain tensors passed to the fatigue analysis for each requested entity of the fatigue analysis for each SUBCASE (or mode). Valid for SOL 101, 103, and 112 only.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum Stress/Strain Range Magnitude or Vector- this is the stress/strain maximum range magnitude (for all scalar COMB values of the FTGPARM entry) or vector (for 2D critical plane* analysis, COMB=CRITICAL) for all requested entities at the critical angle for SOLs 101, 103, and 112 only, as returned from the fatigue analysis. When LOC=ELEM or NODE on the FTGPARM entry, the computed vector is in the basic coordinate system. For LOC=NODA, the computed vector is in the SURFACE system as defined by OUTPUT field on the NAVG line of the FTGPARM entry. For scalar COMB values, a vector is not computed and only the x-component of the vector is provided. The other two components are always zero in this case. Stress/Strain Scalar Response Time History - this is the computed scalar response</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>time history (for all COMBs on the FTGPARM entry) at all time points as returned from the fatigue analysis for SOLs 101, 103, and 112 only. This is the actual response from which rainflow ranges and damage are computed. While individual events are processed, the ALL event is not processed when METHOD=0 on FTGPARM. Also LAYER=1 or 2 on the FTGPARM entry is honored for STROUT=4, but LAYER=0 prints values for both top and bottom. To limit output and ensure decent performance maxENTS on the FTGDEF entry is defaulted to 100 and if the number of entities exceeds this, the job stops. Setting maxENTS to</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>a high number is not recommended due to performance issues. Stress/Strain Tensor Time History - this is the computed tensor time history response at all time points for all requested entities used by the fatigue analysis for SOL 112 only.</td><td>8</td></tr></table></body></html>  

\*COMB $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ CRITICAL on the FTGPARM entry.  

14. STROUT is not honored in manual restarts using SOL FTGRSTRT (automatic restarts are OK). STROUT $\dot{\mathbf{\zeta}}=\mathsf{4}$ may use additional memory space on your system. For STROUT $\stackrel{\cdot}{=}4$ , it is also highly recommended to limit the number of requested entities on the FTGDEF bulk data entry.If the job stops because too many entities are requested, you can set maxENTS on the FTGDEF entry. STROUT $\scriptstyle-4$ has the potential to produce enormous amounts of response data and external files, which can severely affect performance and disk space. STROUT $\overset{\cdot}{=}4$ produces temporary CSV response files of each entity. These CSV files are deleted after the job completes unless $s c\mathbf{r}{=}\mathbf{n}\mathbf{o}$ is used when submitting the job. When METHOD $_{=0}$ on the FTGPARM entry, STROUT $\dot{=}4$ only produces responses for each event. Only when METHOD $^{\prime=1}$ or 2 will STROUT $\overset{\cdot}{=}4$ produce responses for all events combined or if there is only one event.  

15. Output Data Blocks: The following table indicates the output data blocks produced by the FATIGUE case control and which parameters trigger creation of those data blocks. See the DMAP Programmers Guide for a description of these data blocks.

Remarks:  

1. ALL should not be used in a transient problem   
2. See Remark 1 under DISPLACEMENT (Case), 298 for a discussion of SORT1 and SORT2.  

3. ELFORCE is an alternate form and is entirely equivalent to FORCE.   
4.FORCE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ NONE overrides an overall request.   
5.IfPARAM,SPARSEDR,NO is specified, then to request force output on damping elements in modal frequency response analysis (e.g., SOL 111), the mode displacement method (PARAM,DDRMM,- 1) must be selected. Force output on damping elements is not available in transient response analysis.   
6. In nonlinear transient analysis, the FORCE request is ignored for nonlinear elements in SOL129. In SOL400 with "ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLTRAN" Element FORCE output for the CWELD/CFAST elements is available.Allother elements capable of force output such as the CBEAM,CQUAD4,etc., will not produce nonlinear transient force output. If "PARAM, OLDWELD, YES" is specified, then the CWELD/CFAST elements will not produce with "ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLTRAN" Element FORCE output.   
7. The options CENTER, CORNER, CUBIC, SGAGE, and BILIN are recognized only in the first subcase, and determine the option to be used in allsubsequent subcases with the STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE Case Control commands. Consequently, options specified in subcases other than the first subcase will be ignored. The BILIN or CORNER option is not available for advanced nonlinear elements and nonlinear material or composite elements. The default option will be applied to those elements. a. If the STRESS command is specified in the first subcase, then the option on the STRESS command is used in all subcases with STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE commands. b. If the STRAIN command and no STRESS command is specified in the first subcase, then the option on the STRAIN command is used in allsubcases containing STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE commands. c. If the FORCE command and no STRESS or STRAIN commands is specified in the first subcase, then the option on the FORCE command is used in all subcases containing STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE commands. d. If STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE commands are not specified in the first subcase, then the CENTER option is used in allsubcases containing STRESS, STRAIN, and FORCE commands.   
8. The option of PSDF,ATOC, CRMS,and RALL,or any combination of them, can be selected for random analysis. Here PSDF,ATOC and CRMS output is always in SORT2 format.   
9. In general, for nonlinear elements,force output is not available. For CGAP, CELASi, or CBUSH elements in nonlinear analysis, use the STRESS in NLSTRESS command to obtain force output.   
10.Forces and moment output for line elements are total forces and for shell elements they are forces pe unit length.   
11. The FORCE request is ignored for solid elements in allsolution sequences as it has no meaning for solids.  

# Frequency Set Selection  

Selects the set of forcing frequencies to be solved in frequency response problems.  

Format: FREQUENCY $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\tilde{\alpha}}=\mathbf{n}$  

Example: FREQUENCY $=17$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification number of FREQ,FREQ1,FREQ2,FREQ3,FREQ4, and FREQ5 Bulk Data entries. (Integer > 0)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. A frequency set selection is required for a frequency response problem.  

2. A frequency set selection is required for transient response by Fourier methods (SOL 146).  

3.All FREQi entries with the same set identification numbers willbe used. Duplicate frequencies will be ignored. $f_{N}$ and $f_{N-1}$ are considered duplicated if  

$$
\left|f_{N}-f_{N-1}\right|<D F R E Q\cdot\left|f_{M A X}-f_{M I N}\right|
$$  

where DFREQ is a user parameter with a default of 10- . $f_{M A X}$ and $f_{M I N}$ are the maximum and minimum excitation frequencies of the combined FREQi entries, respectively.  

4.If there are multiple frequency response subcases, improved performance can be obtained by making the all the subcases that share the same FREQUENCY ID contiguous. For SOL 20O, it is an error if there are noncontiguous subcases that have the same boundary condition and FREQUENCY ID.  

5. When a FATIGUE case control is also present to perform random vibration fatigue analysis using SOLs 108 and 11l, only one FREQUENCY case control set is allowed for alltransfer function SUBCASEs and should be above the SUBCASE level or only present in lst SUBCASE. The FREQUENCY set cannot change from SUBCASE to SUBCASE or a fatal error is issued.

Remarks:  

1. This command is supported only in SOLs 108 and 111.   
2. A component ID of O is assigned to the assembled FRF configuration resulting from the FBA process.   
3. The COMPNAME keyword must be specified if the COMPID keyword is specified and vice versa.  

4. If the COMPID/COMPNAME keywords are specified along with the GEN/GENASM keyword, then it implies that the FRFs computed for the specified component are employed in a subsequent FBA process. In this case, the FRF generation results will be saved on the specified medium, and the .asm (assembly punch) file willbe generated and saved with a single FRFCOMP Bulk Data entry in it for subsequent use in an FBA process.   
5. If the COMPID/COMPNAME keywords are not specified with the GEN/GENASM keyword, then it implies that the FRFs computed are for a single shot configuration with no subsequent FBA process involved. In this case, the GENASM keyword is equivalent to the GEN keyword.   
6. The COMPID/COMPNAME keywords are ignored if the ASM keyword is specified.   
7. The CONNPTS keyword must be specified if the COMPID/COMPNAME keywords are specified It is ignored otherwise.   
8. If the XITOUT keyword is not specified, the default of XITOU $\mathrm{JT}=\mathrm{UNI}\mathrm{\lbrack\Omega}$ is assumed if there is no DLOAD Case Control request and the default of XITOUT $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ USER is assumed if there is a DLOAD Case Control request. If the user specifies XITOUT $\vec{\mathbf{\sigma}}=\mathbf{U}$ SER or XITOUT $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ USERTOTL, but there is no DLOAD Case Control request, the program issues a warning message and assumes XITOUT $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ UNIT.   
9.If the ASM/GENASM keyword is specified, the resulting FBA process will generate a connection information table in the .fO6 file, indicating the relationship between the internal point IDs of the assembled FRF configuration (referred to as component O as indicated in Remark 2.)and the external point IDs of the associated FRF components.   
10. The normal output from an FBA process run, implied by the default of $\mathrm{ASMOUT}=\mathrm{COMP}$ , gives the results for the individual FRF components that comprise the assembled FRF configuration. If output is also desired for the assembled configuration asa separate entity (component O as indicated in Remark 2.), then ASMOUT $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL must be specified in the FRF command to obtain the expanded output. However, in this case, the output for component O will be limited to displacements, velocities, and accelerations, and these will be output in terms of the internal point IDs mentioned in Remark 9. See Example 3 in Remark 13.   
11. The ASMOUT keyword is ignored if the GEN keyword is specified.  

12. The generation of FRFs for a component and their use in a subsequent FBA processusing the FRF Case Control command involves running a standard SOL 108 or SOL 11l job, with the following additional data:  

a. The DOFs where loads are to be applied must be specified either indirectly via the DLOAD Case Control command and/or directly via the FRFXIT/FRFXIT1 Bulk Data entries. The DLOAD Case Control command points to appropriate Bulk Data loading entries. All DOFs with nonzero load values willhave unit loads applied to them. The FRFXIT entry permits specification ofunit load for a single DOF with a label. The FRFXIT1 entry permits specification of unit loads at multiple DOFs.   
b. There is no requirement that unit loading data be defined for every component for which FRFs are generated, since some components in a configuration may not have any loads applied to them  

c.Regardless of whether an FRF component has unit loads explicitly specified for it, as in Remark 12(a) or not, as in Remark 12(b),the program will internally apply unit loads automatically at all DOFs for all connection points comprising the set referenced by the CONNPTS keyword. This ensures that correct results are obtained from subsequent FBA processes.  

d. The specific points at which FRFs are computed in an FRF generation run consist of the following:  

· All points specified via DISP, VELO, and ACCE requests ● All points associated with elements for which STRESS/FORCE requests are specified ● All points at which unit loads are applied (as per the scheme indicated in Remark 12(a)  

All points comprising the set referenced by the CONNPTS keyword  

All grid points referenced in PLOTEL Bulk Data entries e. It is assumed in an FBA process that the FRFs of allof the FRF components have been generated at the same forcing frequencies, and that these are also the forcing frequencies at which the FBA process is to be performed. As a result, the FBA processderives these forcing frequencies from the saved data of the first of the FRF components being assembled, and uses them in the FBA process.  

In order to ensure the validity of the FBA process,the program checks to make sure that all of the FRF components have been generated using the same number of forcing frequencies and further that all of these forcing frequencies are the same for all of the FRF components. If both of these conditions are not met, the program terminates the job with an appropriate fatal message.  

13. The folowing examples illustrate details of job setups for FRF generation and the subsequent FBA process for various scenarios.  

Example 1 involves FRF generation for a single shot configuration without any FBA process.  

Examples 2 through 5 assume that there are three components - 10, 20 and 30-for which FRFs are to be generated (frgenl0.dat,frfgen20.dat and frgen30.dat) and that the FRFs of these components are to be subsequently assembled in an FBA process to obtain the FRFs of the assembled configuration.  

Example 6 illustrates an FBA process involving the assembly of two components-10 and 20-whose FRFs are generated by Nastran, with a third FRF component- 40-whose FRFs have been generated from test, with its FRF and other information resident on an Universal File (UF).  

Examples 2, 3 and 6 illustrate the use of the ASM option for the FBA process while Examples 4 and 5 illustrate the use of the GENASM option for the FBA process.  

Examples 7 through 13 deal with an airplane model comprising five FRF components, namely, fuselage (1),horizontal tail (2),verticaltail (3),inboard wings (4) and outboard wings (5). Example 7 illustrates the generation of the FRFs for these five components while the other examples are FBA jobs that illustrate the generation and usage of ICFs (inter component forces)for several scenarios using the ICFGEN, ICFUSE and ICFAUTO keywords of the FRF Case Control command, employing both database and OUTPUT2 usage.  

Loading data must be defined for Example 1 either via FRFXIT/FRFXIT1 Bulk Data entries or via the DLOAD Case Control request. For all other examples, loading data may be defined as desired either in the FRF generation runs or in the FBA process or both.

Remarks:  

1. The printing of the grid point forces will be suppressed if PARAM,NOGPF,-1 appears in the Bulk Data.   
2. The Bulk Data entry PARAM,NOELOF, $+1$ will cause the output of the grid point forces to be aligned with the edges of the two-dimensional elements. The default value of-1 willsuppress this output. See Remark 4.   
3. The Bulk Data entry PARAM,NOELOP $^{+1}$ will cause the output of the sum of the forces parallel to the edges of adjacent elements. The default value of -1 will suppressthis output. See Remarks 4.and 10.   
4.The output of grid point forces aligned with the edges of elements is available for the following elements:  

CBAR CROD CBEAM CSHEAR CONROD CTRIA3 CQUAD4 CTUBE  

The positive direction for grid point forces aligned with the edges of elements is from the reference point to the load point as indicated on the printed output. See Remark 10.  

5.The grid point force balance is computed from linear and nonlinear elements, and includes the sum of applied loads, contact force, thermal loads, MPC forces, rigid elements, general elements, DMIG entries and SPC forces. Effects not accounted for include those from mass elements in dynamic analysis (inertia loads), slideline force contributions, and boundary loads from upstream superelements. These effects may lead to an apparent lack of equilibrium at the grid point level. The following table summarizes those effects that are considered and those effects that are ignored in the calculation of grid point forces in the global coordinate system:

6.Only the element elasticforces are included when the grid point forces are aligned with the edges of elements. See Remark 10.  

7.In inertia relief analysis, the SPCFORCE and applied load output includes both the effect of inertia loads and applied loads.  

8. When pressure loads are applied, the GPFDR module uses the discrete load vector and does not include any distributed effects.  

9. GPFORCE is not available in SOLs 108, 11l or 129.  

10.Grid point force output is available for nonlinear static analysis for SOLs 106 and 400.SOL106 with thermal loading does not back out the thermalload so result willnot sum to zero,this is a limitation of SOL106.

Remarks:  

1. Grid point kinetic energy is only available for normal modes analysis.  

2. Both PRINT and PUNCH may be requested.  

3. GPKE $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ NONE overrides an overall output request.  

4. For models using the lumped massformulation, the grid point kinetic energy can be used to examine the distribution of kinetic energy among the grid points. It is computed as:  

$$
E_{k_{g}}^{\phantom{e}}=\ \Phi_{g}^{m a s s}\otimes[M_{g g}\Phi_{g}^{m a s s}]
$$  

where Φmass represents the massnormalized eigenvectors so that the total grid point kinetic energy is scaled to be unity. Note that the operator $\otimes$ indicates term-wise matrix multiplication.  

5. The grid point kinetic energy output has limited meaning for a coupled mass formulation.Since this mass formulation produces a coupling of massacross grid points, the sharing ofkinetic energy among grid points can occur. In general, this obscures the meaning of the computation as a means of identifying important model parameters to control modal behavior.

Remarks:  

1. GROUNDCHECK must be specified above the subcase level.   
2.SET $\mathrm{\dot{\bar{\rho}}_{=}N+\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\rho}}$ AUTOSPC (check the N-set stiffness, including the effect of PARAM,AUTOSPC) uses the stiffness matrix for the n-set, with the rows corresponding to degrees-of-freedom constrained by the PARAM,AUTOSPC operation zeroed out. If AUTOSPC was not performed, then this check is redundant with respect to $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{ET=N} Ḍ$   
3.If DATAREC $\c=$ YES, GROUNDCHECK FORCES willbe printed in the displacement coordinate system of the associated GRID points.   
4. For CBEAM/CBEAM3, it is recommended to use SPOINT ID for warping DOFs. Use of GRID ID for warping DOFs may cause one or more directions to fail the rigid body check.  

5. If Lagrange multipliers are present via RIGID $\mid=$ LAGRAN or LGELIM then for degree-of-freedom sets N, $\Nu_{+}$ AUTOSPC, F, and A the check will be performed on degree-of-freedom sets NL, NL $+.$ AUTOSPC, FL, and AL. The output will also be labeled accordingly.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>N</td><td>Meaning Identification number for a HADAPTL Bulk Data entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The HADAPT command can be used only in SOL 101 or SOL 400 with ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ STATICS. HADPAT cannot be used in Linear Contact Analyses.   
2. In SOL 101, with NO SUPERELEMENTS, the HADAPT command may appear either above all SUBCASEs or within specific SUBCASEs. In the last scenario, only stresses on the solution corresponding to the specific SUBCASE where the HADAPT command has been placed will be used to compute error indicators should the user requests an error indicator based refinement criterion (see Bulk Data entries, HADACRl, 2123 and HADAPTL, 2126).If superelements are present, then the HADAPT command should appear only in Residual Superelement (SE0) SUBCASE structure.   
3. In SOL 400, the HADAPT command can only be placed on a Linear static structural analysis SUBCASE (ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ STATICS) either above all STEPS or within each single STEP. All STEPs must be Linear Static structural STEPS (ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ STATICS). In other words an adaptive meshing linear analysis cannot be chained with any other analysis type.  

4. HADAPT remeshing should only be performed on lower order elements.

Remarks:  

1. If no HARMONICS command is present in the Case Control Section for axisymmetric shellor fluid problems, printed output is prepared only for the zero harmonic.   
2. This command must be present in cyclic symmetry problems with HARMONICS $\O=$ ALL or n; otherwise, the program will abort without performing any analysis.   
3. In cyclic symmetry analysis, n must be defined as a set of integers on a SET command.

Remarks:  

1. If no FATIGUE case control is defined, this output request is ignored.   
2. This output request has the potential to create many thousands of files if the ALL option is used.A separate file for each time history and/or histogram for each entity is created. It is recommended to specify a SET to limit the output.   
3．IfFORMAT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ BINARY, file formats are DAC for time histories and S3M for histograms. If FORMAT $\stackrel{\cdot}{=}.$ ASCII, both time histories and histograms are output in CSV format.   
4.File names produced by this option are cryptic and increment by the number of time histories or histograms being processed. You must open each file to check for which element, node, and layer it is associated with.  

5. This option is not supported for duty cycle analysis and will be ignored with no output generated. Specificall this occurs when the FTGSEQ bulk data entry references more than one FTGEVNT or more than one repeat of a single FTGEVNT entry.

1. Set k must be defined on a SET command, and output willbe computed for allavailable harmonics in SET k.   
2. HOUTPUT $\mathbf{\lambda}=\mathbf{\lambda}$ ALL requests output for all harmonics specified on the HARMONICS command.   
3. Either the HOUTPUT or NOUTPUT command is required to obtain data recovery in cyclic symmetry analysis.   
4.C and S correspond to the cosine and sine coefficients when the STYPE field is ROT or AXI on the CYSYM Bulk Data entry.

# Remarks:  

1.For structural analysis, TIC entries willnot be used (therefore, no initial conditions) unless selected in the Case Control Section.   
2. Only the PHYSICAL option (Default) may be specified in heat transfer analysis (SOLs 159, 400 and 600). The initial temperature of a point should be equal to its boundary temperature at time $=0$ . For SOL 400 transient thermal analysis, the boundary temperature at time $=0$ takes precedence over the initial temperature if both temperatures are not identical.   
3. IC(MODAL) may be specified only in modal transient analysis (SOL 112).   
4. IC(STATSUB) and IC(STATSUB,DIFFK) may not both be specified in the same execution.

2. In SORT1 format, ICFs recovered at consecutively numbered scalar points are printed in groups of six (sextets) per line of output. However,ifa scalar point is not consecutively numbered, it will begin a new sextet on a new line of output. Ifa sextet can be formed and all values are zero,then the line will not be printed. If a sextet cannot be formed, then zero values may be output.   
3.ICFs are defined only for the connection points of FRF components in an FBA job and are regarded as null for non-connection points of FRF components. Therefore, ICF output is meaningful only for the connection points of FRF components in an FBA job.   
4. In SORT1 format, ICF output is ignored for non-connection points and willbe output for the requested connection points of FRF components only if their ICFs are non-null.   
5. In SORT2 format, ICF output is honored for all requested connection and non-connection points of FRF components even if their ICFs are null.   
6. ICF output request is ignored for undefined points.

Selects nonlinear inertia relief set for SOL 400  

Format: IRLOAD= QLINEAR NONE  

Example: IRLOAD $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ QLINEAR   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>QLINEAR</td><td>Inertia Load Calculation with small displacement (Quasi-Linear) is activated in SOL 400.</td></tr><tr><td>NONE</td><td>No Inertia Relief (Default)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remark:  

1. This command is active only in SOL 400 with ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLSTATIC and its use requires a set of STATIC supports that constrain all six rigid body motions.   
2.IRLOAD $\mid=$ QLINEAR, which has to be applied above to all SUBCASES, is a global case control command and activates the inertia load calculations in SOL 400 for all applied static loads. In nonlinear static analyses (ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTAT), it also activates the inertia relief analysis with small displacement. When IRLOAD $\mid=$ QLINEAR with large displacement (PARAM,LGDISP,1), a fatal error message will be issued. Also superelements in conjunction with IRLOAD $\mid=$ QLINEAR will cause a fatal error. IRLOAD $\mid=$ NONE (default) deactivates the inertia load calculations.   
3.IRLOAD $\mid=$ QLINEAR is ignored by perturbation analyses in SOL 400.

Selects an external static load set.  

Format: LOAD $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\alpha=n}$  

Example: LOAD $=15$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of at least one external load Bulk Data entry. The set identification must appear on at least one ACCEL, ACCEL1, FORCE, FORCE1, FORCE2,FORCEAX, GRAV, LOAD, MOMAX, MOMENT,MOMENT1, MOMENT2, MPCD, PLOAD, PLOAD1, PLOAD2, PLOAD4, PLOADB3, PLOADX, QVOL, QVECT, QHBDY, QBDY1, QBDY2, QBDY3, PRESAX, RFORCE, SPCD, or SLOAD entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1.A GRAV entry cannot have the same set identification number as any of the other loading entry types. Apply a gravity load along with other static loads, a LOAD Bulk Data entry must be used.   
2. LOAD is only applicable in linear and nonlinear statics, inertia relief, differential stiffness, buckling, and heat transfer analyses.   
3. The total load applied will be the sum of external (LOAD), thermal (TEMP(LOAD)),element deformation (DEFORM), and constrained displacement (SPC) loads.   
4. Static, thermal, and element deformation loads should have unique set identification numbers.  

Provides a name to be associated with a loading condition.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>Load_name</td><td>Character string (up to 64 characters long) providing a user-defined name for a loading in PAA.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remark:  

1. This command is used only in PAA and provides a user-defined name for a loading condition   
2. LOADNAMEs may be used to combine loads in a COMBINE or SOLVE PAA run using a LOADCNAM Bulk Data entry.   
3. The LOADNAME command is ignored in non-PAA applications  

Selects a sequence of staticload sets to be applied to the structural model.Theload sets may be referenced by dynamic load commands.  

Format: LOADSET $\cdot_{\mathrm{=n}}$  

Example: LOADSET $\mathtt{\Omega}=100$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td> Set identification number of at least one LSEQ Bulk Data entry. (Integer > 0)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. When used in superelement analysis, this command must be used for allsuperelements. The number of static load vectors created for each superelement depends upon the type of analysis. In static analysis,the number of vectors created is equal to the number of unique EXCITEIDs on all LSEQ entries in the Bulk Data; in dynamic analysis, the number of vectors created is equal to the number of unique EXCITEIDs on all RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1, TLOAD2 and ACSRCE entries in the Bulk Data.   
2. When the LOADSET command is used in superelement statics,the residual structure should have as many loading conditions as the number of unique EXCITEID sets defined on allLSEQ entries. The subcases after the first should contain only SUBTITLE and LABEL information, and residual structure output requests.SUBTITLE and LABEL information for all superelements will be obtained from the residual structure.   
3. When multiple subcases are specified in the dynamic solution sequences (SOLs 108,109,1l1,112, 118, 146), the LOADSET must appear in the first subcase or above all subcases. In SOL 200 with ANALYSIS $\O=$ DFREQ, MFREQ, or MTRAN, a different LOADSET may be specified in the first subcase pertaining to each ANALYSIS command.   
4.In SOL 101, the design sensitivity output will identify all expanded subcases by a sequence of uniqu integers beginning with n.   
5. In the nonlinear static solution sequences (SOLs 106 and 153), the LOADSET must appear above all subcases and only one LOADSET may be specified.   
6. Only one LOADSET command is allowed per superelement and it must be specified in the superelement's first subcase.   
7. It is no longer necessary to employ LOADSET/LSEQ data to specify static loading data for use in dynamic analysis. In the absence of a LOADSET Case Control command, allstatic loads whose load set IDs match the EXCITEIDs on all RLOAD1, RLOAD2, TLOAD1, TLOAD2, and ACSRCE Bulk Data entries are automatically processed.   
8.. If you use the LOADSET command in a static analysis, the loading matrix will be generated corresponding to, and in ascending order of, the EXCITEID's on the referenced LSEQ entries. Any LOAD commands within subcases will be ignored.   
9. Use of the LOADSET/LSEQ should be avoided as it is an obsolete entry and is never needed and is only documented for legacy code. Some new features such as SUBSTEP do not support it and will issue a fatal message.

Remarks:  

1. DMIG matrices will not be used unless selected.   
2. Terms are added to the mass matrix before any constraints are applied.

4. M2GG input is not affected by PARAM,WTMASS.M2GG input must either be in consistent mass units or PARAM,CM2 may be used.   
5. The matrices are additive if multiple matrices are referenced on the M2GG command.   
6. The formats of the name list: a. Names without factor. Names separated by comma or blank. b. Names with factors. Each entry in the list consists ofa factor, followed by a star,followed by a name. The entries are separated by commas or blanks.The factors are real numbers. Each name must be paired with a factor including 1.0.  

7. If there are multiple subcases in the analysis.the M2GG command must appear above the first subcase or in the first subcase.M2GG requests in the second and subsequent subcases will be ignored. For superelements. it should occur in the first subcase for the appropriate superelement.

Remarks:  

1. DMIG and DMIAX entries will not be used unless selected by the M2PP input.   
2. M2PP input is not affcted by PARAM,WTMASS.M2PP input must be in consistent mass units.   
3.The matrix must be square or symmetric, and field 4on the DMIG, name entry must contain a l or 6   
4.It is recommended that PARAM,AUTOSPC,NO be specified. See Constraint and Mechanism Problem Identification in SubDMAP SEKR in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
5. M2PP matrices are used only in dynamic response problems. They are not used in normal modes problems.   
6. The matrices are additive if multiple matrices are referenced on the M2PP command.  

7. The formats of the name list:  

a. Names without factor Names separated by comma or blank.   
b. Names with factors.

The factors are either all real numbers, or all complex numbers in the form of two real numbers, separated by a comma, within parenthesis as shown in the preceding example. The first real number of the pair is the real part, and the second is the imaginary part. Either part may be zero or blank, but not both. Mixed real numbers and complex numbers are not allowed. Each name must be with a factor including 1.0 for real and (1.0, 0.0) for complex.  

Selection of a mass combination in multiple mass combination analysis (MMC). This case control command can be used in various solutions sequences SOLs 101, 103, 107-112,144-146, 200 and 400.  

Format: $\mathbf{MASSET}=\mathbf{n}$  

Example: MASSSET = 11  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Set ID of a MASSSET bulk data entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. Using a particular mass combination in analysis only requires referencing the mass combinations ID in MASSSET case control at the subcase level (or at step level in Sol 400). Ifno MASSSET is defined in the subcase then (like traditional non MMC analysis) the base massis used as the mass for that subcase. Example for selecting mass combinations at the subcase level: SUBCASE 101 MASSSET $\mathbf{\Phi}=\mathbf{\Phi}_{11}$ \$ SUBCASE 102 MASSSET $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\ 12\ \mathbf{\Sigma}\ \boldsymbol{\Sigma}$  

2. The MASSSET bulk data entry defines a linear combination of incremental/base masscases to form the subcase-dependent mass. The bulk data for the incremental mass case is preceded by“BEGIN MASSID $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ yy”，where $\mathrm{\yy}>0$ is the integer ID of the massincrement case.The only data that will be used from the incremental mass bulk data section is element connections and element mass properties including materials (Parameters and grid data included in the incremental mass section wil be ignored). The incremental mass will be computed based on the grid data supplied in the base mass bulk data section and the element properties supplied in the incremental mass section. Typically the user will construct the incremental mass by adding concentrated masses (e.g. CONM2, CMASS1 etc.) or by changing the material or element properties of the set of elements defined in incremental mass bulk data section.  

BEGIN massid $\scriptstyle=101$ label $\c=$ 'mass increment using conm2s' BEGIN massid $\scriptstyle=102$ label $\c=$ 'mass increment using materials'  

3.If Part SE are used in the model, mass increment related to these SEs can be specified ina separate bulk data section,“BEGIN SUPER $\therefore$ zzzMASSID $\c=$ yyy"，where $z z z>0$ is the Superelement ID and yyy is the mass increment ID.  

BEGIN SUPER $^{\underline{{{\O}}}}=2$ massid $\scriptstyle.=101$ label $\c=$ 'mass increment using conm2s'  

Allows the redefinition of a MASTER subcase.  

Format: SUBCASE n MASTER  

Example: SUBCASE 10 MASTER  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ｎ</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. All commands in a MASTER subcase apply to the folowing subcases until a new MASTER subcase is defined.  

2. Suppose that superelement 10 has SPC set 10, MPC set 10, and LOAD sets 101 and 102. Suppose also that superelement 20 has SPC set 20, MPC set 20, and LOAD sets 201 and 202. Then the following Case Control setup specifies the required subcase structure:  

TITLE $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ MY MODEL$\begin{array}{l}{\mathsf{D I S P}}\end{array}=\begin{array}{l}{\mathbb{A I}}\end{array}$ LSEAL $\mathrm{~\texttt~{~L~}~}=\mathrm{~\texttt~{~F~}~}$ LL  
SUBCASE 101MASTER$\mathtt{S P C}~=~10\$ $\mathrm{{MPC}~}=~10$ SUPER $\mathit{\Theta}=\ 10$ ，1$\tt{L O A D}~=~101$ LABEL $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ SUPER 10ESE $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ ALL  
SUBCASE 102LOAD = 102SUPER $\mathit{\Theta}=\ 10$ ，2  
SUBCASE 201MASTER$\mathtt{S P C}~=~20\$ $\mathrm{MPC}~=~20\$ SUPER $=~20$ ，1$\tt{L O A D}~=~201$ LABEL $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ SUPER 20  
SUBCASE 202LOAD $=\ 202$ SUPER $=~20$ ，2  

3. MASTER may also be used advantageously in multiple boundary condition Case Control setups. Suppose that constraint sets 10 and 20 are to be solved with three loading conditions each: 1,2,and 3; and 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The following Case Control Section may be used:  

TITLE $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ MULTIPLE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS $\begin{array}{l}{\tt{D I S P}=\tt{\mathbb{A}I}}\end{array}$ L SYM 1 MASTER $\mathtt{S P C}~=~10\$ $\tt L O A D\ =\ 1$ SYM 2 LOAD = 2 SYM 3 LOAD = 3 SYM 4 MASTER $\mathrm{SPC}~=~20\$ LOAD = 4 SYM 5 LOAD = 5 SYM 6 $\mathtt{L O A D}\ =\ \mathtt{6}$ SYMCOM 10 SYMSEQ = 1.,1.,1.,-1.,-1.,-1. SYMCOM 20 $\mathrm{SYMSEQ~=~-1~.~,~\-1~.~,~\-1~.~,~\1~.~,~\1~.~,~\1~.~,~\1~.~}$ 4. The MASTER command must appear immediately after a SUBCASE or SYM command.  

Sets the maximum number of output lines.  

Format: MAXLINES $\mathtt{\Gamma}=\mathtt{n}$  

Example: MAXLINES=150000  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Meaning Maximum number of output lines allowed (Integer > 0; Default = 999999999).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. If MAXLINES is exceeded, the program will terminate.   
2. MAXLINES does not override any system parameters such as those on job control language commands.   
3. MAXLINES may also be specified on the NASTRAN statement with SYSTEM(14).See the Executing MSC Nastran.   
4. The code counts the number of pages and asumes that the number of lines output is the number of lines allowed per page, specified by the“LINES" command, times the number of pages.

# Remarks:  

1. The MAXMIN command produces an algebraically ascending sorted list of the output quantities specified for all ofthe points in the selected set.MAX refers to the largest magnitude positive values, while MIN refers to the largest magnitude negative values. The output format is similar to that of displacement output. Allcomponents will be output for a grid point, and the order of the grid points will be in sort on the particular component that was surveyed. The output title contains the identification number of the set of points participating in the max/min output, the coordinate system frame of reference, the number of MAX and MIN values output, and the component that was surveyed. When the output being surveyed is in the global output coordinate system reference frame, and BASIC or a local output coordinate system is specified as cid, both the sorted system output and the original reference system output are displayed for the grid point if these systems are different.  

2. Vector magnitude results are computed for both translations and rotations and are displayed under the Tl and Rl column headings. The presence of the COMP keyword is ignored.  

3. The default value of 5 generates a minimum of 10 output lines for the BOTH option. There will be 5 maximum values and 5 minimum values produced. In addition, if coordinate system are involved, both surveyed and original data willbe output. This could result in as many as 10 more lines of output for each surveyed component.  

4. Multiple MAXMIN commands may be specified for a subcase. This permits diffrent output quantities to have different MAXMIN specification within a subcase. For example,  

SET $501=1$ ,3,5,7 THRU 99，1001，2001MAXMIN（DISP， $\mathsf{C O M P=T}3$ )= 501MAXMIN (SPCF， $\mathrm{COMP=T1/R3)}=\mathrm{\ALL}$  

5. Scalar point output is included only if component T1 is included in the list.  

6. MAXMIN output willonly be generated for items in the oplist when there is an associated Case Control command present. For example, a DISP Case Control command must be present in order for the MAXMIN(DISP) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL command to produce output. Use of ALL keywords for the oplist requests MAXMIN output for all output commands acceptable to MAXMIN that are present in Case control Section.  

Requests the output of maximums and minimums in data recovery.

Remarks:  

1. MAXMIN is not allowed in REPCASE, but is allowed in SUBCOM and SYMCOM.   
2. The OTIME command may be used to limit the time span of monitoring.   
3. No corresponding output request such as DISP, STRESS, etc., is required (Except for STRAIN). Also, $S{\mathrm{ET}}=\mathbf{n} $ may request more elements or grid points for monitoring than is requested by Outputs Currently for strain the output request STRAIN $\scriptstyle\mathbf{\bar{\alpha}}=\mathbf{n}$ is required where n can reference any element. If strain at fibers is requested then, then STRAIN (FIBER) ${\bf\alpha}={\bf n}$ is required. The output is comprised of two parts: (1) a summary of the maximum/minimum values and the times they occur, and (2) the associated output for all components of the element or grid. The first part is always output, and the second part is only output if the FULL describer is specified on the MAXMIN(DEF) Case Control command. See the next section for a description of the new Case Control commands. Here are sample Case Control commands for the output of maximum von Mises stresses using the BRIEF option: MAXMIN(DEF） STRESS QUAD4 SMAX1 ABSOLUTE（5） BRIEF SET $\scriptstyle100=4$ MAXMIN(ELEM) $=4$   
4. See DISPLACEMENT, STRESS, or STRAIN Case Control commands for additional keyword implications.  

Defines parameters and output options for the monitoring of maximums and minimums in data recovery. MAXMIN(DEF) must be specified above allsubcases. The MAXMIN(ELEM) and/or MAXMIN(GRID) Case Control command is then required to print the max/min results.

# Remarks:  

1. MAXMIN(DEF) must be specified above all subcases, but this is not suffcient to request monitoring of maximums and minimums. The MAXMIN command must also be specified above or inside subcases.   
2. MAXMIN(DEF) may be specified more than once.   
3. Multiple element types may be grouped together, if the same component name is to be monitored across those types, by enclosing the element types in parentheses. This grouping does not combine the element types during processing. Each type and component action is performed in class.   
4. Multiple component names may be compared collectively to the current maximum (or minimum), but only the maximum (or minimum) component in the group will be reported in the output. This is requested by enclosing the component names in parentheses.   
5. Grid point component output is always converted to the basic coordinate system for monitoring when processing “sortl". The global system is the default when processing in “sort2".   
6. Results for layers in composite elements, or intermediate stations in CBAR and CBEAM elements, are not supported.   
7. Only real data recovery is supported.   
8. When no MINA, MAXA, or ABSO keyword is supplied, the default values of p,q, and s will be 5. When any keyword is supplied, the other unreferenced keyword values will be set to zero, and no output will be created.   
9. The component action keywords of CENTER, ALL, GROUP, and ENDS can only be applied to component names defined in the NDDL and occur at multiple places in element data recovery. They cannot be used with Item Codes.   
10. Specify CQUAD4C and CTRIAC for corner stresses of CQUAD4 and CTRIA3 elements.   
11. MAXMIN data output to the .op2 and .xdb files are not supported.   
12. SORT1 and SORT2 output Case Control options (such as DISP(SORT2) $\begin{array}{r}{{\bf\Pi}^{\prime}=\frac{\bf{\Pi}}{\bf{\Pi}}}\end{array}$ ALL), cause MAXMIN to behave differently. SORT1 is only supported in SOLs 101, 103, 105, and 109. For each static loadcase, mode buckling eigenvalue, or time step, all the grids or elements willbe searched for maximums and minimums. SORT2 is only supported in SOL 112. For each selected grid or element, allthe time steps will  

be searched for maximums and minimums.

# Remarks:  

1. The MCFRACTION Case Control command is useful in modal frequency response (SOL 111), modal transient response (SOL 112), and modal complex eigenvalue analysis (SOL 110) solution sequences only. If superelements are used, its use is restricted to residual structure data recovery operations only. MCFRACTION is not supported in SOL 200 or 400.   
2. Printed output includes results for all of the data items described in the itemlist table.   
3. Punched output includes results for only the data items selected by the ITEMS keyword.   
4. Modal contribution fractions are sorted by increasing order of mode number unlessthe SORT keywords specifies a particular sorting order. Ifa sorting order is specified, the KEY keyword selects the particular data item in the printed results tabular outputlisting that is sorted. When MODEDISP is selected, the magnitude is sorted. When MODERESP is selected, the real portion of the response is sorted.   
5. The SOLUTION keyword can be used to select a subset of the solutions available.If SET m is specified, the items in the SET list are forcing frequency values, time step values, or complex eigenvalue mode numbers, depending upon the solution sequence used.   
6.The FILTER keyword specifies a filter ratio value that is used to limit the amount of printed output produced.Itapplies to the data item selected by the KEY keyword if it is specified.If no KEY keyword is present, the default value od KEY $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ FRACTION will be used. The maximum value for the selected data item acrossallnatural modes is determined. If the ratio of the data item value to the maximum data item value is less than fratio for any natural mode, no output for that natural mode is produced.   
7.Iftheagdeoftheoarespeataecedgiitptieshanow no modal contribution fraction output is generated for that degreeoffreedom. If ipowr is not in the range of 1 to 31, the default value of 12 is used for ipowr, producing a null response threshold of 1.0 × 10-12.   
8.For modal transient response solution sequences,response quantities are real numbers.There are no imaginary terms. Therefore, polar representations of the data has no meaning. Furthermore, projections of responses onto the total response are simply the individual modal contribution to the total response at a degree of freedom. Thus, the only items available for output are the individual modal response magnitude (PROJECTION), the modal fraction (FRACTION), and the scaled response magnitude (SCALED).Selection of any of the other items from the itemlist table causes selection of the modal response magnitude (PROJECTION) item.   
9. A request of MCFRACTION output for a SET that contains no degrees-of-freedom in the analysis set, will result in the message: “SYSTEM WARNING MESSAGE 2001 (MCFRAC)"  

Indicates which MCHSTAT Bulk Data entry option will be used to control the state variables (temperatures)used in this subcase for a thermal stress simulation in SOL 600.

Remarks:  

1. The SUMMARY describer produces three outputs: a. Modal effective mass matrix $[\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{E}}^{T}][m][\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{E}}]$ where:  

8 $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Modal participation factors: $[m^{1}][\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T}][M_{a a}][D_{a r}]$ $m$ $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Generalized mass matrix.   
$\begin{array}{r l}{\phi}&{{}=}\end{array}$ Eigenvectors. ${{M}_{a a}}=$ Mass marix reduced to the a-set ( $\mathrm{g}$ -set for superelements).   
$D_{a r}=$ Rigid body transformation matrix with respect to the a-set.  

b. A-set rigid body mass matrix: $[D_{a r}^{T}][M_{a a}][D_{a r}]$ . For superelement this is computed at the g-set c.Total effective mass Fraction: i.e., diagonal elements of the modal effective mass matrix divided by the rigid body mass matrix.  

2. The PARTFAC describer outputs the modal participation factors table ε.  

3.The MEFFMdescriberoutputs the modaleffectivemasstable $\mathrm{\varepsilon}^{2}$ ,the term-wise squareoffthe moda participation factors table.   
4.The MEFFW describer outputs the modal effective weight table;i.e., the modal effective mass dividec by PARAM, WTMASS.   
5. The FRACSUM describer outputs the modal effective mass fraction table; i.e., the generalized mass matrix (diagonal term) multiplied by the modal effective mass divided by the rigid body mass matrix (diagonal term).   
6. For superelements, the MEFFMASS Case Control command uses the residual structure eigenvalues and eigenvectors, by default. If, however, PARAM, FIXEDB,-1 is specified, then the MEFFMASS Case Control command uses the component mode eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Remarks:  

1. An eigenvalue extraction method must be selected when extracting real eigenvalues.   
. If the set identification number selected is present on both EIGRL and EIGR and/or EIGB entries, the EIGRL entry will be used.   
. METHOD(FLUID) and METHOD(STRUCTURE) permits a different request of EIGR or EIGRL for the fluid portion of the model in coupled fluid-structural analysis. · If METHOD(STRUCTURE) or METHOD(FLUID) is also specified, then they will override the METHOD(BOTH) selection. The METHOD(FLUID) and METHOD(STRUCTURE) may be specified simultaneously in the same subcase for the residual structure only. Do not specify METHOD(FLUID) in a superelement subcase even if the superelement contains fluid elements. The auto-omit feature (see Real Eigenvalue Analysis in SubDMAPs SEMR3 and MODERS in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide) is not recommended. Therefore, only those methods of eigenvalue extraction that can process a singular mass matrix should be used; e.g.,the EIGRL entry, or MGIV and MHOU on the EIGR entry.  

4. METHOD(COUPLED) is only used when STRUCTURE and FLUID COUPLED problem. The corresponding EIGRL or EIGR requires either the frequency range of interest or ND (number of roots desired) entry. The real coupled modes computation is done with combination of Lanczos method and Subspace iteration method.  

METHOD(COUPLED) is recommended for heavy fluid (like liquids) model. When it is applied to the light fluid model, it might require more coupled modes to get the correct result.  

Real coupled method is not supported in SOL 200 and SOL 400. If Case Control METHOD(COUPLED) is used in SOL 200 or SOL 400, the following error message will be returned:  

\*\*\* USER FATAL MESSAGE 22996 (SUBDMAP PREOPT)

The presence ofany active MAT1F, MAT2F,MAT8F, or MAT9F entry or the combined presence of any MAT1F,MAT2F, MAT8F, MAT9F entries and any PBUSHT, PELAST, PDAMPT entries a master frequency will initiate the master frequency feature in frequency analysis.  

2. MFREQ should be above or in the first subcase.  

3.The K,B, and K4 matrices, at master frequencies, are formed in the standard way, using material and property values at the associated current master frequency.  

4. For frequencies selected between master frequencies,interpolation of the K, B, and, K4 matrices are performed. These interpolated frequencies are selected using the required Case Control $\mathrm{FREQ=m}$ entry.  

5. Interpolation between master frequencies $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{lm}}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{2\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{i}$ .is $\mathrm{K_{ij}=(d_{2}K^{l m}\mathbf{i}j+d_{1}K^{2m}\mathbf{i}j)/(d_{1}+d2)}$ where.  

For Linear: $\mathrm{d}1=(\mathrm{f-f1});\quad\mathrm{d}2=(\mathrm{f}2-\mathrm{f})$ For Log10: $\mathrm{d}1=(\log10(\mathrm{f})-\log10(\mathrm{f}1));\mathrm{d}2=(\log10(\mathrm{f}2)-\log10(\mathrm{f}))$   
6. For master frequencies there is full displacement, velocity, acceleration type data recovery as wellas full element force and stress type data recovery.   
7.For interpolated frequencies, there is only (a-set)or modal (h-set)displacement,velocity,acceleration type data recovery. Because,the solution of interpolated frequencies is based on interpolated K, B, and K4, there is no element data recovery at interpolated frequencies.   
8.For modal frequency analysis,associated with master frequencies,residual vector methods for viscous and structural damping have been greatly enhanced and orthogonalization techniques are employed which require the removal of free -free modes. For this reason the structure must be statically constrained with the use of SUPORT entries. Case Control selectable SUPORT1 entries may also be used.   
9. For preloading (STATSUB), with the presence of any MAT1F, MAT2F, MAT8F, MAT9F entries or the combined presence of any MAT1F, MAT2F, MAT8F, MAT9F entries and any PBUSHT, PELAST, PDAMPT entries, a fatal message will be issued. \*\*\* USER FATAL MESSAGE 22711 (MTMD56) FREQUENCY case control command missing for frequency response analysis. STATSUB static loading is not currently supported for frequency dependent material/property.   
10. PARAM, NMNLFRQ, REAL (Defaul $\scriptstyle\mathtt{\tilde{\Lambda}=0.0}$ ) allows users to select material or property values for frequency dependent materials or properties at a desired frequency other than the“nominal" values specified on the MATi or PBUSH, PCOMP, PCOMPG, PDAMP,or PELAS entries. These values are used in determining the eigenvalue solution used in the modal frequency analysis.  

11. If a user supplies a FREQ, FREQ1, or FREQ2 entry with a 0.0 value of forcing frequency the following message will be issued:  

\*\*\* USER WARNING MESSAGE 22714 (SUBDMAP MFREQRS)  

Forcing frequency value of 0.0 detected, nominal (initial) material properties used.  

The rational for this selection is that $0.0\mathrm{Hz}$ is a static solution and SOL 10l would use material nominal.  

12. Some examples of interaction between MFREQ $\O=$ AUTO and an always required $\mathrm{FREQ=m}$ and interpolated values are as follows:  

If frequency dependent TABLEDi entries associated with the presence of any MAT1F, MAT2F, MAT8F, MAT9F entries or the combined presence of any MAT1F, MAT2F, MAT8F, MAT9F entries and any PBUSHT, PELAST, PDAMPT entries are detected, and the user has not specified any MFREQ Case Control entries, then Nastran willautomatically scan the TABLEDi entries. Nastran does this by using the required $\mathrm{{FREQ=m}}$ entry and for any TABLEDi where there is a TOL jump between two consecutive $\mathrm{FREQ=m}$ frequencies determining a“Master frequency".

Processing:  

Modal kinetic energy is calculated using the following relations:  

For transient analysis,  

$$
[A c t u a l~K E]=\frac{1}{2}\{{\dot{u}}_{h}\}^{T}[M_{h h}]\{\dot{u}_{h}\}
$$  

For frequency response analysis,  

$$
[A c t u a l K E]=\frac{1}{2}\{u_{h}\}^{T}[d i a g(\mathfrak{o}_{i}^{2})][M_{h h}]\{u_{h}\}
$$  

where ${\boldsymbol{\mathsf{\omega}}}_{i}$ is the excitation frequency and output is complex. See Remark 4 of the EKE (Case) Case Control command for energy calculation relations when output is real.

Modal strain energy is calculated using the following relations:  

$$
[A c t u a l~S E]~=~\frac{1}{2}{\{u_{h}\}}^{T}[M_{h h}]\{u_{h}\}
$$  

For frequency response analysis real output, see Remark 4 of the ESE(Case)Case Control command for energy calculation relations.  

[Normalized Strain Energy] $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ norm[Actual Strain Energy], normalized per column. [Fractional Strain Energy] $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ [Normalized Strain Energy]/[diagonal ${[\left\{1.0\right\}^{T}}$ [Normalized Strain Energyll], term-by-term division.  

Repeats a subcase.

Example: MODES $\scriptstyle:=3$   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Meaning Number of times the subcase is to be repeated (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. This Case Control command can be illustrated by an example.Suppose stress output is desired for the first five modes only, and displacements for the next two modes, and forces for the remaining modes. The following example would accomplish this:  

SUBCASE 1 $\$5$ FOR MODES 1 THRU 5   
$\begin{array}{l l l}{\mathbb{M}\mathrm{ODES}}&{=}&{5}\end{array}$   
$\mathrm{STRESS}~=~\mathrm{\mathbb{A}L L}$   
SUBCASE 6 $\$5$ FOR MODES 6 AND 7   
DISPLACEMENTS $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ ALL   
$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{\DeltaMODES}}\end{array}=\begin{array}{l}{2}\end{array}$   
SUBCASE $8\ \mathrm{~\textperthousand~}$ FOR MODE 8 AND REMAINING MODES   
FORC $\begin{array}{r}{\begin{array}{r c l}{\mathtt{E}}&{=}&{\mathtt{A L I}.\mathtt{I}}\end{array}}\end{array}$  

2. This command causes the results for each mode to be considered as a separate, successively numbered subcase, beginning with the subcase number containing the MODES command. In the preceding example, this means that subcases 1, 2, 3, etc.are assigned to modes 1, 2, 3, etc., respectively.  

3.If this command is not used, eigenvalue results are considered to be a part of a single subcase. Therefore, any output requests for the single subcase will apply for all eigenvalues.  

4.All eigenvectors with mode numbers greater than the number ofsubcases defined in the Case Control Section are printed with the descriptors of the last subcase.For example, to suppress all printout for modes beyond the first three, the following Case Control commands could be used:  

SUBCASE 1   
$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{\DeltaMODES}}\end{array}=\begin{array}{l}{3}\end{array}$   
DISPLACEMENTS $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ ALL   
SUBCASE 4   
DISPLACEMENTS $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ NONE   
BEGIN BULK  

5. This command may be ofno use in non-eigenvalue analysis and may cause data recovery processing to be repeated.

# Remarks:  

1. This command is meaningful only in modal dynamic analysis (SOLs 110, 11l, 112, 145, 146, and 200). It is ignored in all other analyses.   
2. Only one MODESELECT command is alowed for the structure and only one MODESELECT command is allowed for the fluid and these should be specified above the subcase level.   
3. The various formats of this command may not be combined.   
4. The computed modes used for mode selection include the augmented modes (if any) resulting from residual vector calculations.   
5. If LMODENM is specified without HMODENM, a default value of 1000000 (ten million) is assumed for HMODENM. If HMODENM is specified without LMODENM, a default value of 1 is assumed for LMODENM.   
6. If LFREQ is specified without HFREQ, a default value of $1.0\mathrm{E}{+30}$ is assumed for HFREQ. If HFREQ is specified without LFREQ, a default value of 0.0 is assumed for LFREQ.   
7. If the format involving the MEFFMFRA criteria is employed, it is not necessary to specify a MEFFMASS Case Control command or, even if such a command is specified, to explicitly request the calculation of the modal efective mass fractions. In the absence of such a command or request, the program willautomatically perform the necessary calculations internally to ensure that the required modal effective mass fractions are computed.   
8.If the T1FR / R1FR / ALLFR keywords are specified without the corresponding tifr/ rlfr / allfr threshold values, then a default value of 0.95 (that is, $95\%$ ）is assumed for these threshold values. If the selection criterion is SUM, and a default value of 0.05 (that is, $5\%$ ） is assumed if the selection criterion is ANYMIN or ALLMIN.   
9. The modal effective mass for a given mode is a measure of how much mass is associated with that mode,and indicates the sensitivity of that mode to base excitation. Modal effective mass is meaningful only for fixed base modes.If a structure is not restrained, allthe modal effective mass will be associated with its rigid body modes.  

10. When the MODESELECT Case Control command is used in conjunction with the parameters LMODES/LMODESFL, LFREQ/LFREQFL, and HFREQ/HFREQFL, the hierarchy of their usage is as follows:  

a. If there is a MODESELECT Case Control command, it takes precedence over the parameters LMODES/LMODESFL, LFREQ/LFREQFL, and HFREQ/HFREQFL. (It does not matter whether these parameters are defined directly via PARAM entries, or indirectly using the FLSFSEL Case Control command.) b. If there is no MODESELECT Case Control command, then parameter LMODES/LMODESFL takes precedence over parameters LFREQ/LFREQFL and HFREQ/HFREQFL. In this case, the number of lowest modes specified by LMODES/LMODESFL will be included in the modal dynamic analysis. c. If there is no MODESELECT Case Control command and no LMODES/LMODESFL parameter, then parameters LFREQ/LFREQFL and HFREQ/HFREQFL are honored. In this case, all of the computed modes whose frequencies are in the range specified by LFREQ/LFREQFL and HFREQ/HFREQFL will be included in the modal dynamic analysis. d. If there is no MODESELECT Case Control command and no LMODES/LMODESFL, LFREQ/LFREQFL, or HFREQ/HFREQFL parameter, then allof the computed modes will be included in the modal dynamic analysis.   
11. If a subset of the computed modes is selected for subsequent use in the modal dynamic analysis, the user is informed of this by a User Information Message. Also, a new eigenvalue table indicating the actual modes selected for the analysis is output. If the user has employed a MODESELECT command involving the MEFFMFRA criteria, the modal effective mass fractions for the selected modes are also output.   
12.If the mode selection criterion results in no modes being selected for subsequent use in the modal dynamic analysis, the program terminates the job with a fatal message indicating that no modal formulation is possible.   
3. If the use of the MODESELECT command results in the selection of allof the computed modes for subsequent use, the user is informed of this by a User Information Message.   
14.The following examples illustrate the use of the various formats of the MODESELECT command described above.

Examples lustrating Mode Selection Based on Modal Effective Mass Fraction (MEFFMFRA) Criteria:  

MODESELECT (T3FR)  

The default selection criterion of SUM is assumed, and a default value of 0.95 $(95\%)$ is therefore assumed for the threshold value for component T3.  

As many modes with the highest MEFFMFRA(T3)values as possible, such that the sum of the values is equal to or just exceeds 0.95, will be selected.  

MODESELECT $(\mathrm{T1FR~=~}~0.90$ T2FR R3FR = 0.85)  

The default selection criterion of SUM is assumed, and a default value of 0.95 $(95\%)$ is therefore assumec for the threshold value for component T2.  

As many modes with thehighest MEFFMFRA(T1) values as possible, such that the sum of the values is equal to or just exceeds 0.90, will be selected.  

Similarly, as many modes with the highest MEFFMFRA(T2) values as possible,such that the sum of those values is equal to or just exceeds 0.95, will be selected.  

As many modes with the highest MEFFMFRA(R3)values as possble, such that the sum of those values is equal to or just exceeds 0.85, will be selected.  

MODESELECT (T1FR $\mathrm{T}3\mathrm{FR}\ =\ 0.10$ UNCONSET $\mathit{\Theta}=\mathit{\Theta}-6$ ANYMIN) $\$5$ SET 6 NOT DEFINED  

Since the selection criterion is specified as ANYMIN, a default value of 0.05 $(5\%)$ is assumed for the threshold value for component T1.  

All modes, excluding mode 6, whose:  

MEFFMFRA(Tl) values are equal to or greater than 0.05 OR MEFFMFRA(T3) values are equal to or greater than 0.10  

will be selected.  

SET $1000~=~20~$ ，30MODESELECT $(\mathrm{T}2\mathrm{F}\mathrm{R}\ =\ 0.1$ $\mathrm{R}3\mathrm{FR}\ =\ 0.15$ ALLFR UNCONSET $\mathbf{\lambda}=\mathbf{\lambda}_{1000}$ ALLMIN)  

The ALLFR flag indicates that the T1,T3, R1, and R2 components which are not explicitly specified above must also be considered in mode selection. Since the selection criterion is specified as ALLMIN, a default value of $0.05\:(5\%)$ is assumed for the threshold value for these components.  

All modes whose:  

MEFFMFRA（T1） values equal or exceed 0.05 ANDMEFFMFRA（T2） values equal or exceed 0.10 ANDMEFFMFRA(T3) values equal or exceed 0.05 ANDMEFFMFRA(R1) values equal or exceed 0.05 ANDMEFFMFRA(R2) values equal or exceed 0.05 ANDMEFFMFRA(R3) values equal or exceed 0.15 AND  

will be selected.

# Mode Tracking Request  

Selects mode tracking options in design optimization (SOL 200)  

Format: MODTRAK $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{n}$  

Example:  

MODTRAK=100   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a MODTRAK Bulk Data entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remark:  

1. Selection of a MODTRAK Bulk Data entry with the MODTRAK Case Control command activates mode tracking for the current subcase. This request is limited to normal modes subcases (ANALYSIS $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ MODES) in design optimization (SOL 200).  

Control for Monte-Carlo simulation using the non-parametric variability method (NPVM).This Case Control command can be used in SOL 11l only.  

Format: MONCARL（[NSAMPLE $=\mathtt{m}$ ]，[SEED $\mathrm{=k}$ ],[OFFD $\c=$ r])= n  

Example: MONCARL(NSAMPLE $:=100)=5$  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>NSAMPLE = m</td><td>Specifies the number of random samples, m ( Integer >=0, Default = 0).</td></tr><tr><td>SEED = k</td><td>Specifies the random number generator seed, k (Integer > 0, Default = 777).</td></tr><tr><td>OFFD = r</td><td>Specifies the scale factor for off-diagonal entries of the random matrix, r (Real, Default = 1.0).</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td> Set identification number of a MONCARL Bulk Data entry (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. Only one MONCARL command may appear in the Case Control Section and should appear above all SUBCASE commands.   
2. Keeping in mind the size and the naively parallel nature of Monte-Carlo problem typical simulation would be run in a parallel mode. The parallel DMP simulation is restricted to Multi-Master mode in order to get a good scalable performance. Multi-Master mode can be specified using "RUNOPT $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ MULTIMST", in "DOMAINSOLVER" Executive Control statement, e.g.: DOMAINSOLVER ACMS（PARTOPT $\backslash=$ DOF， RUNOPT $\mathop{\left.\sum}\right\vert=$ MULTIMST)   
3. Running the Monte-Carlo simulation in Nastran would result in a concatenated OP2, HDF5 and PCH file containing the response results of each random sample of Monte-Carlo simulation. Each random sample would appear as a unique subcase in the OP2, HDF5 and PCH file.   
4. PLT Viewer (provided with Nastran) can be used to read the result of Monte-Carlo simulation to generate meaningful response statistics. Currently the PLT Viewer can only read HDF5 and“PCH files in SORT 1 format" (not OP2).   
5. HDF5 is the recommended output method for reading into PLT Viewer. Use NASTRAN system cell (702) $\mathrm{HDF5}{=}1$ to request HDF5 output.  

Specifies options in the printing of monitor data.  

Format:  

ALLMONITOR[REALorIMAG,PHASE, NODSP1,NOPNTI,NOPNT2,NOPNT3]NONE  

MONITOR(PHASE,NOPNT1) $\c=$ ALL MONITOR(IMAG,NODSP1) $\begin{array}{r}{{\bf\Psi}={\bf\Psi}}\\ {{\bf\Psi}}\end{array}$ ALL  

Example:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>REAL or IMAG</td><td>Requests rectangular format (real and imaginary) of complex output. Use of either REAL or IMAG yields the same output (Default).</td></tr><tr><td>PHASE</td><td>Requests polar format (magnitude and phase) of complex output.

Remarks:  

1. The MONITOR command is required in order to obtain MONITOR results in the printed output in SOLs 101,103,108,109,111,112,146,200 and 400 (ANALYSIS $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ NLSTAT or NLTRAN).  

2. SOL 144 does not require the MONITOR command and is ignored  

3. The MONITOR command should be above the subcase level or in the first subcase (above the step level for SOL 400). MONITOR commands in subcases subsequent to the first one or in any steps for SOL 400 are ignored.  

4. MONPNT1 is not applicable in SOL 103.  

5. The MONITOR command is not required for SOL 144 except in the special case of MONPNT3 with any exclusion flags other than SMAD. Monitor points with exclusion flags require special processing of the GRID point force data and are not recommended because of the potential excessve cost.  

6. Results for dynamic solutions (SOLs 108, 109, 111, 112, 146 and 400 with NLTRAN) will be in SORT2 format. All other solutions will be in SORT1 format.

1. In cyclic symmetry analysis, this command must appear above the first subcase command.   
2. Multiple boundary conditions (MPC sets)are not allowed in superelement analysis. If more than one MPC set is specified per superelement (including the residual),then the second and subsequent sets will be ignored.   
3. In addition to select MPC/MPCADD bulk data entries, $\mathrm{MPC=n}$ can also be used to select a group of rigid elements for the analysis via SET3,n bulk data entry with RBEin or RBEex in DES field of SET3 bulk data entry.   
4. SET3,n is not needed if ALL rigid elements in the model are to be utilized.   
5. Rigid element set section is supported in SOL 400 if 'RIGID $\mid=$ LINEAR' is present in case control deck.

# Remarks:  

1. See Remark 1 under DISPLACEMENT (Case),298 for a discussion of SORT1 and SORT2. In the SORT1 format, only nonzero values will be output.   
2.In a statics problem, a request for SORT2 causes loads at allpoints (zero and nonzero) to be output.   
3. MPCFORCES $\c=$ NONE overrides an overall output request.   
4. In SORT1 format, MPCFORCEs recovered at consecutively numbered scalar points are printed in groups ofsix (sextets) per line of output. However, if a scalar point is not consecutively numbered, then it willbegin a new sextet on a new line of output. If a sextet can be formed and all values are zero, the line will not be printed. If a sextet cannot be formed, then zero values may be output.   
5. MPCFORCE results are output in the global coordinate system (see field CD on the GRID Bulk Data entry).   
6. MPCFORCE results due to linear elements only are available in SOL 129 with MDLPRM, MPCF129, 1.   
7. In inertia reliefanalysis,the MPCFORCE output includes both the effects of applied and inertial loads.   
8. The option of PSDF, ATOC, CRMS, and RALL, or any combination of them, can be selected fo random analysis. Here PSDF,ATOC and CRMS output is always in SORT2 format.   
9. Note that the CID keyword affects only grid point related output, such as DISPlacement, VELO, ACCE, OLOAD, SPCForce and MPCF. In addition, the CID keyword needs to appear only once in a grid related output request anywhere in the Case Control Section to turn on the printing algorithm.

Perform a nonlinear buckling analysis in SOL 400.  

Format:  

Examples: NLBUCK NLBUCK $\varXi$ END NLBUCK $\varXi$ ALL NLBUCK $\scriptstyle:=0$ .3  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>END</td><td>At the end of the step an eigenvalue projection is made to predict the buckled load (Default).</td></tr><tr><td>ALL</td><td>After each converged load increment within the step an eigenvalue projection is made to predict the buckled load.</td></tr><tr><td>r</td><td>After every multiple of r load step an eigenvalue projection is made to predict the buckled load. Buckling will also be computed at the final load increment.A tolerance of 1.E-6 is used to determine the load step's closeness to r. (Real)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remark:  

1. The eigenvalue projection is only attempted after the first two converged load increments in order for there to be at least two tangent stiffness matrices for the projection.   
2. NLBUCK may be specified in any STEP or SUBCASE.   
3. In order to obtain the most accurate value for critical buckling factor, the user must set $_{\mathrm{NO}=1}$ or the smallest practical value on the NLSTEP entry or INTOUT $\dot{\bf\Phi}=\bf\Phi $ YES, ALL, or the largest practical value on the NLPARM entry. Specifying PARAM,LGDISP $^{\cdot}{>}0$ is also recommended.   
4. In addition to NLBUCK, a METHOD Case Control command may be specified to reference an EIGB, EIGR or EIGRL Bulk Data entry, or if asymmetric follower stiffness exists then a CMETHOD Case Control command may be specified to reference an EIGC entry. The EIGx entries should request the computation of at least the first mode. If no METHOD/CMETHOD command is present, a minimum oftwo eigenvalues are extractedfor the buckling projection using an eigenvalue extraction method appropriate for the form of the tangent stiffness(symmetric or asymmetric). For manual control of follower stiffness symmetry see the description of user PARAMeters FOLLOWK and FKSYMFAC.   
5.If NLBUCK $\scriptstyle\mathtt{\bar{\alpha}=0.3}$ and the TOTTIME on the NLSTEP Buck Data entry is 1.O then the buckling will be computed at load steps 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.0. Also, if the load factor is not a multiple of r then the next load factor will be used; for example, if TOTIME $_{\cdot=1.0}$ and there are 50 load increments and $\mathbf{r}{=}.45$ then buckling will be computed at load factors 0.46, 0.90, and 1.0.   
6. There are three methods of eigenvalue extraction available for nonlinear buckling—Lanczos (EIGRL or EIGR entry with METHOD $\mid=$ LAN),enhanced inverse power method (EIGB entry with METHOD $\vDash$ SINV), and complex (EIGC entry) for unsymmetric stiffness due to follower stiffness. a. If no METHOD or CMETHOD command is specified, then the program willautomatically attempt to compute two modes ( $_{\mathrm{ND}=2},$ with an unspecified values for the eigenvalue range (F1 and F2) using the Lanczos method. b. The Lanczos method is recommended in most cases especially in finding the lowest mode. c.If no modes can be found with no eigenvalue range was specified, then it is highly recommended that a range (Ll and L2 on EIGB,F1 and F2 on EIGR, and V1 and V2 on EIGRL) be specified. d. If higher modes are desired, then the enhanced inverse power method is recommended with a narrow eigenvalue range specified for Ll and L2 on the EIGB entry. e. If a METHOD command is specified but the stiffness is unsymmetric then User Warning Message 9430 will be issued.  

7. Guidelines and limitations:  

a. NLPARM Case Control command is not permitted in a nonlinear buckling step. NLSTEP must be specified in the nonlinear buckling step and KMETHOD $\vDash$ PFNT (default) is strongly recommended along with $_{\mathrm{NO}=1}$ for FIXED time stepping or INTOUT $\mathbf{\bar{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ YES for ADAPT time stepping. If KMETHOD $\vDash$ ITER then KSTEP $^{\circ}=1$ is strongly recommended.   
b. It is strongly recommended that PARAM,LGDISP,1 is specified.   
c. RIGID $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ LAGRANGE or LGELIM with advanced nonlinear elements is not supported in nonlinear buckling analysis.   
d. It is strongly recommended to specify an eigenvalue range on the EIGR, EIGRL, EIGB, and EIGC Bulk Data entries. But with NLBUCK $\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}_{\mathbf{\Pi}}=\mathbf{\Pi}$ ALL it may be difficult to define a range for all load increments.   
e. Node-to-segment is not recommended except in the case of permanent glue contact.

1. This entry references the NLHARM Bulk Data entry which defines the number ofsubharmonics anc harmonics to be used in the analysis as well as referencing the excitation frequency specification.   
2. Gyroscopic terms are included if the RGYRO Case Control command and Bulk Data entry are specified. Ifgyroscopic terms are desired, the user must specify the constant rooter speed (ASYNC option) for the reference rotor.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>SUBCASE</td><td>Keyword to select the SUBCASE ID</td></tr><tr><td>i</td><td>Specifies the identification number of a previously executed subcase. (Integer > 0; Default is the subcase where the current NLIC is located).</td></tr><tr><td>STEP</td><td>Keyword to select the STEP ID.</td></tr><tr><td>j</td><td>Specifies the identification number of a previously executed STEP (Integer > 0, Default is the last STEP).</td></tr><tr><td>LOADFACT</td><td>Keyword to select load factor or time.

(Real ≥ 0.0; Default = 1.0E-06)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The NLIC command can only point to a load increment whose output flag is on -an available restar point in the static analysis. IfNLIC is not pointing to an available restart point, afatal error will be issued and the job will be terminated.   
2. The NLIC can be used in nonlinear static, nonlinear transient and perturbation analysis. If SUBCASE referred in NLIC is not the current SUBCASE, this usage is not recommended. The system $(779)=1$ may be used to avoid this usage, which stops the job in this case.   
3. For nonlinear transient analysis (ANALYSIS $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ NLTRAN), NLIC can only appear in the first transient analysis STEP in a SUBCASE.(Note that the first transient analysis step may not be the first step of subcase.) Otherwise, it will be ignored and a warning message will be issued.   
4. For linear perturbation analysis, NLIC must point to a previous NLSTATIC step in the same SUBCASE.   
5. If NLIC is specified without any of the keywords, or NLIC is not present in a nonlinear STEP or perturbation STEP, the initial condition or PRELOAD is taken from the last available restart point in the immediate previous static step.   
6. In the same nonlinear transient step, NLIC cannot appear together with the IC Case Control command.A fatal error message will be issued if NLIC and IC appear in the same step. Please note that IC is meaningful only in the first STEP ofa SUBCASE, and the step is a nonlinear transient analysis.   
7.When Keyword NEAR is used,the search for the nearest load factor or time is limited inside the specified SUBCASE i STEP j.   
8. NLIC can be used in SOL 400 only.   
9. If NLIC is used with ANALYSIS $\c=$ NLSTATIC it may cause convergence problems. If NLIC is used across different subcases: the initial conditions, the deformation, the strains, the stresses, etc., are carried over between Subcases. However, the load is NOT carried over.This can cause an unbalanced load condition that may cause convergence problems.

Remarks:  

1. This Case Control command is used to better control nonlinear solution output during solution process, to provide MSC users a direct accessto nonlinear solutions even the job is stillrunning, to give the users some tools to debug the nonlinear solution process and gain some insight of nonlinear solution procedure, and to allow users to print out MPC and MPCY equations from contact constraints before and during solution process.  

2. OUTCTRL $\v{r}_{\mathbf{\lambda}}=$ SOLUTION is designed to debug nonlinear analysis which may fail during the analysis. For other selections, some results such as displacement, SPC force, and so on, are written into F06 file only after the analysis is finished completely. This is helpful for user to understand the nonlinear analysis when job is terminated abnormally. With OUTCTRL $\v{x}_{1}=$ SOLUTION, only part of the results willbe output.Availabilityofoutput request fordebugging purposesare summarizedatthefollowing table.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Output Request</td><td>OP2</td><td>F06</td></tr><tr><td>BOUTPUT</td><td>NO</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>DISPLACEMENT</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>GPFORCE</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>MPCFORCES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>NLSTRESS</td><td>NO</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>OLOAD</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>SPCFORCES</td><td>YES</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>STRESS</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>STRAIN</td><td>NO</td><td>NO</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Please note that OP2 file only includes the results at the end time of every load step, instead of the user-specified output intervals assgned in NLSTEP or NLPARM. It is recommended to use OUTCTRL $\v{x}_{1}=$ SOLUTION,INTERM to get nonlinear solutions in both FO6 and intermediate OP2 files for debugging purposes.  

3. For OUTCTRL $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ INTERM, the intermediate ouptut is only available in OP2 file. GPFORCE is not available in intermediate OP2 files and can be obtained by OUCTRL $\v{r}_{0}$ STD.  

4. For NLDBG, all nonlinear information is printed out in only F06 file.  

5. For DBGPOST, all nonlinear information is printed out in the MASTER/DBALL.  

6. For MPCPCH, it is a punch output that MPC and MPCY requests cannot be mixed.  

'. In MPCPCH punch output, it is restricted that $S I D=1$ for a general contact and $S\mathrm{ID}{=}2$ for the glued contact.   
8. When using MPCPCH for the permanent glued contact, user may specify any keyword of BEGN, STEP and OTIME to punch output MPC type of constraints, or any keyword of YBEGN, YSTEP and YOTIME to punch out MPCY type of constraints.   
9.The output to the file is also influenced by the NLPACK Param. For example, one NLTRAN analysis has NLSTEP as: NLSTEP,900,0.2 ,fixed,2000,20 ,mech,u It has total 2000 increments, and is asked output every 20 increments.Therefore,total output is 100 time step. In NASTRAN, default value of NLPACK is 100, in this model, therefore, NASTRAN will write the results to OP2 after collecting 100 output,i.e., this model will write results to OP2 only one time. With "intermediate output request, you will have only one OP2 file. If NLPACK $_{.=1}$ , NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every output request. In this model, NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every output request, i.e., writing 100 times in this model With "intermediate output request, you will have 100 OP2 files. If NLPACK $_{.=2}$ , NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every two output requests. In this model, NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every two output request, i.e., writing 50 times in this model. With "intermediate output request, you will have 50 OP2 files.

Please be cautious in using OVERRIDE because the model changes may result in wrong answers and/or a fatal termination and, therefore, is not recommended in all cases.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The NLRESTART command can be used in SOL 400 (NONLIN) only. 2. The NLRESTART command must appear before any SUBCASE command. 3.To perform a restart, the data base for the original run must be madeavailable by using the ASSIGN File Management statement or other equivalent method.  

4.The restart run can only be executed at aload increment (or time step) whose output flag is on an available restart point. (See the field INTOUT on the NLPARM Bulk Data entry, and NO on ). When a user-specified restart point is not available, the closest previous restart point that is available will be applied automatically.  

5. If only NLRESTART is specified, a restart begins from the last available restart point in the previous run. Otherwise, at lease one set of the SUBCASE i, STEP j,or LOADFC f(or TIME t) must be specified.   
6. In static analysis, f is reset to 0.0 when $\mathrm{f}<0.0$ , and it makes the restart begin from the beginning of STEP j. f is reset to 1.0 when $\mathrm{f}>1.0$ , which makes the restart begin from the beginning of the next STEP (after STEP j).   
7. In transient analysis, t is reset to $t_{0}$ when $\mathbf{t}<t_{0}$ , and it makes the restart begin from the beginning of STEP j. t is reset to $t_{n}$ when $\mathbf{t}>t_{n}$ , which makes the restart begin from the beginning of the next STEP (after STEP j).   
8. The NLRESTART Case Control command must contain allof the commands used in the original execution up to the point where the restart is requested.   
9. All data contained on the database from the restart point will be deleted when the restart begins.   
10. When using NLRESTART, its corresponding COLD START input model should not use "PARAM,DBALL,SCRATCH", which will remove the database required for NLRESTART after completion of COLD START run.   
11. NLRESTART is used for Nonlinear Restart Request. The restart step must be a nonlinear analysis, NLSTAT or NLTRAN. NLRESTART from perturbation step or thermal analysis step is not supported in SOL400.   
12.DBSAVE in the Case Control Section is used to control saving of datablocks of advanced nonlinear elements for static and transient nonlinear analysis in SOL 400.   
-1 No datablocks of advanced nonlinear elements is saved   
0 Saving datablocks of advanced nonlinear elements at the end of each loadcase (default)   
$>0$ Saving datablocks of advanced nonlinear elements at the every nth output request of results  

In DBSAVE $_{.=0}$ , NLRESTART may start at the end of the loadcase (load step) for advanced nonlinear elements. If DBSAVE $\scriptstyle\cdot=\mathrm{n}$ $(>0)$ , NLRESTART may start at the every INTOUT\* n th output point.  

For NLTRAN analysis in SOL 400, the output to the file,i.e., NLRESTART usage,is also influenced by the NLPACK Param. For example, one NLTRAN analysis has NLSTEP as:  

NLSTEP, 900, 0.2 ,fixed,2000,20 ,mech,u  

It has total 2000 increments,and is asked output every 20 increments. Therefore,total output is 100 time step.In NASTRAN, default value of NLPACK is 100, in this model, therefore, NASTRAN will write the results to OP2 after collecting 100 output,i.e.,this model will write results to OP2 only one time. With intermediate output request, you will have only one OP2 file.   
If NLPACK $_{.=1}$ , NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every output request. In this model, NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every output request, i.e., writing 100 times in this model. With intermediate output request, you will have 10o OP2 files.   
If NLPACK $_{.=2}$ , NASTRAN will write results to OP2 for every two output requests. In this model, NASTRAN willwrite results to OP2 for every two output request, i.e., writing 50 times in this model. With intermediate output request, you will have 50 OP2 files.   
Similarly, NLRESTART can be started at those output points ONLY.

Remarks:  

1． NVELOCITY $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ NONE overrides an overall request.   
2. The PLOT option is used if results are requested for post-processing but no printed or punched output is desired.   
3. Even with NVELOCITY $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ all, Velocity Normal will be computed only for structural grids at the surface of the model. Fluid grids, if exist, are not included in NVELOCITY output.   
4. With ERP flag in NVELOCITY command, structural grids of all ERPPNL willbe considered as candidates for NVELOCITY output and subjected to further screening of NVELOCITY set.   
5. For 3D model, ERPPNL points to SET3 with all PSOLID IDs in the model is the easiest way to compute NVELOCITY of structural surface GRIDs.   
6. This Case Control command can be used in SOL 108 and SOL 11l only  

Selects a set of frequencies for output requests.  

Format:

$$  

OFREQUENCY $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ ALL OFREQUENCY $=15$  

Examples:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>ALL</td><td>Output for all frequencies will be computed.</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a previously appearing SET command. Output for frequencies closest to those given on this SET command will be output (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. In real eigenvalue, buckling, and complex eigenvalue analyses, the OMODES Case Control command allows for an alternate way of selecting the modes to be output based on their mode numbers.In these cases,ifboth the OMODES and OFREQUENCY requests appear, the OMODES request takes precedence.  

2. If this command is not specified in the Case Control Section (or, in the case of real eigenvalue, buckling, and complex eigenvalue analyses, if neither the OMODES nor the OFREQUENCY request is specified), then output will be generated for all frequencies.  

3.The number of solutions selected willalways be equal to the number of quantities in the selected set The closest values are used.  

4.In flutter analysis (SOL 145),the selected set refers to the imaginary partof the complex eigenvalues. The physical interpretation of this quantity depends on the method of flutter analysis as follows:  

● K- or KE-method: velocity (input units) PK-method: frequency.  

5. In aeroelastic response analysis (SOL 146) with RLOAD selection, the selected set refers to the frequency (cycles per unit time).  

6. In complex eigenvalue analysis (SOLs 107 and 110),the selected set refers to the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues.  

7.If this command is specified in more than one subcase, then it is recommended that the first subcase contain OFREQ $\sqsubset$ ALL, and that subsequent subcases contain $\mathrm{OFREQ}=\mathfrak{n}$ Also, data recovery requests should be specified only in the subsequent subcases. For example:  

SUBCASE 1   
OFREQ = ALL \$ 0.0 through 0.5   
SUBCASE 2   
SET $10~=~0.0~0.1~0.3$   
$\mathrm{{OFREQ}}~=~10~\$   
$\Delta I{\mathrm{SP}}~=~\mathrm{\mathbb{A}}\mathrm{{LL}}$   
SUBCASE3   
SET $20~=~0.4$ 0.5   
OFREQ $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=\mathbf{\varepsilon}_{20}$   
$\mathrm{\DeltaSTRESS~=~\mathbb{A}L L}$  

Request output imperfection vectors in SOL 400.Imperfection vectors are coordinate variations applied on grid points to express geometric imperfection.

# Remarks:  

1. See Remark 1 under DISPLACEMENT (Case),298 for a discussion of SORT1 and SORT2. In the SORT1 format, only nonzero values will be output.   
2. In a statics problem, a request for SORT2 causes loads at all requested points (zero and nonzero) to be output.   
3.OLOAD $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ NONE overrides an overall output request.   
4.In the statics superelement solution sequences,and in the dynamics solution sequences (SOLs 107 through 112, 118, 145,146, and 200). OLOADs are available for superelements and the residual structure.Only externally applied loads are printed. Loads transmitted from upstream superelements are not printed. Transmitted loads can be obtained with GPFORCE requests. In the nonlinear transient analysis solution sequences (SOLs 129 and 159),OLOADs are available only for residual structure points and include loads transmitted by upstream superelements.   
5. In nonlinear analyses SOL 106 and 129, OLOAD output will not reflect changes due to follower forces.But SOL 400 OLOAD output reflects the follower force change correctly. Notes, in SOL 400, the first OLOAD output before starting nonlinear iteration process, only reflects total non-follower force without thermal load and follower force.   
6. Loads generated by the SPCD Bulk Data entry do not appear in OLOAD output.   
7. In SORT1 format, OLOADs recovered at consecutively numbered scalar points are printed in groups of six (sextets) per line of output. However, if a scalar point is not consecutively numbered, it will begin a new sextet on a new line ofoutput.Ifa sextet can be formed and it is zero, then the line will not be printed. If a sextet cannot be formed, then zero values may be output.   
8. OLOAD results are output in the global coordinate system (see field CD on the GRID Bulk Data entry).   
9.In static inertia relief analysis, the OLOAD output includes both the inertia loads and applied loads.   
10. The option of PSDF,ATOC, CRMS, and RALL,or any combination of them, can be selected for random analysis. Here PSDF, ATOC and CRMS output is always in SORT2 format.   
11. Note that the CID keyword affects only grid point related output, such as DISP, VELO, ACCE, OLOAD, SPCF and MPCF. In addition, CID the keyword needs to appear only once in a grid point related output request anywhere in the Case Control Section to turn on the printing algorithm.  

12. OLOAD output is not available in SOL 600.  

Selects a set of modes for output requests.  

Format:  

$$
O M O D E S=\left\{\begin{array}{c}{{A L L}}\\ {{n}}\end{array}\right\}
$$  

OMODES $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ALL $\mathrm{OMODES}~=~20$  

Examples:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>ALL</td><td>Output for all extracted modes will be computed (Default).</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification of a previously appearing SET command. Output for those extracted modes appearing on this SET command will be computed.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. This command is valid only in SOLs 103, 105, 107, 110,111,112, 200 and 400. It is ignored in al other analyses.  

2. In contrast to the OFREQENCY Case Control command, which provides an alternate way of selecting the modes to be output based on their frequencies, the OMODES command alows mode selection based on integer mode ID. For example:  

SUBCASE 10 SET $\mathrm{11}\ =\ \mathrm{1},\mathrm{3},\mathrm{5},\mathrm{7}$ $\mathrm{\OMODES}\ =\ 11$ $\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{~DISP~}=~\mathrm{\mathbb{A}L I}}\end{array}$   
SUBCASE 20 SET $21\ =\ 25.,28.,31.$ OFREQ $\mathbf{\lambda}=\mathbf{\lambda}21$ $\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{~DISP~}=~\mathbb{A}.}\end{array}$ LL   
▪·▪   
3. If both the OMODES and the OFREQUENCY requests appear, the OMODES request takes precedence.   
4.If neither the OMODES nor the OFREQUENCY request is specified, output willbe generated for all modes.   
5. Note that the OMODES command has no effect on the number of modes computed.It only selects a subset of the computed modes for which output is to be generated.   
6. In superelement analysis, the set definition, using an OMODES command, for an upstream superelement, willnot be recognized unless a similar request appears for its downstream neighbor. The downstream request should either be comprised of the union of all upstream requests, or left blank, as the OMODES default is ALL. Note that the program does not check to see if this condition is satisfied.   
7. IfOMODES is used in conjunction with a FATIGUE case control command, the OMODES request must be for contiguous modes from 1 through n and the FTGLOAD bulk data entries cannot invoke modes greater than n.   
8.OMODES is intended to be specified above all subcases or in the first subcase. In SOLs 200 and 400, the first subcase would be the first subcase with ANALYSIS $\O=$ MODES,MTRAN,MFREQ,MCEIG, SEAERO, and FLUTTER. See the MODES command to allow different output requests for individual modes.  

Selects a set of times for output requests.  

Format:  

$$
O T I M E\ =\ \left\{\begin{array}{c}{{{\cal A}{\cal L}{\cal L}}}\\ {{n}}\end{array}\right\}
$$  

# Examples:  

OTIME ${\tt\tt=}\tt{A I}\tt{L I}$ OTIME $=15$  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>ALL</td><td>Output for all times will be computed.</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification number of a previously appearing SET command. Output for times closest to those given on this SET command will be computed (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. If the OTIME command is not supplied in the Case Control Section, then output for all times wi be computed.   
2. This command is particularly usefulfor requesting a subset of the output (e.g.,streses only at peak times, etc.).   
3. This command can be used in conjunction with the MODACC module to limit the times for which modal acceleration computations are performed.   
4.If this command is specified in more than one subcase in the modal solution sequences, then it is recommended that the first subcase contain OTIME $\left.=\right.$ ALL, and that subsequent subcases contain OTIME $_{,=\mathrm{n}}$ . Also, data recovery requests should be specified only in the subsequent subcases. For example: SUBCASE 1 OTIME ALL SUBCASE 2 OTIME $\mathit{\Theta}=\ 10$ SET $\begin{array}{l l}{\displaystyle10}&{\displaystyle=}\end{array}$ $\Delta I S P=\Delta\mathrm{LL}$ SUBCASE 3 OTIME $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=\mathbf{\varepsilon}_{20}$ SET $20\ =$ $\mathrm{STRESS}~=~\mathrm{\mathbb{A}L L}$  

5. The OTIME command is not efective in nonlinear transient analysis (SOL 129).However, the OTIME command can be used in the nonlinear transient thermal analysis (SOL 159) to limit the output to specified output times.  

6. In superelement analysis, the set definition, using an OTIME command for an upstream superelement, willnot be recognized unless a similar request appears for its downstream neighbor. The downstream request should either be comprised of the union of all upstream requests, or left blank, as the OTIME default is ALL. Note that the program does not check to see if this condition is satisfied.  

Delimits the various types of commands for the structure plotter, curve plotter, grid point stress, and MSGSTRESS.

# Remarks:  

1. All PFMODE(FLUID), PFPANEL, and PFGRID Case Control commands must reference the same set of acoustic grid points. 2. Keywords FLUIDMP and PANELMP are only valid if FLUID is specified. 3.If STRUCTURE is specified, setdof must reference a set of structural degrees of freedom. If FLUID is specified, setdofmust reference a set of acoustic grid points. 4. Acoustic MPFs are available in a coupled modal frequency response analysis (SOL 1ll) only.   
5. Printed output includes results for ALL the data items described in the Item List Table. 6. Punched output includes results for only the data items selected by the ITEMS keyword. 7. MPFs are sorted by increasing order of mode number unless the SORT keyword specifies a different sorting order.Ifa sorting order is specified, the KEY keyword selects the item that is used for sorting. When MODEDISP is selected, sorting is based on the magnitude. When MODERESP is selected, sorting is based on the real part.   
8. The STRUCTURE option selects MPF calculations for structural degrees of freedom. The STRUCTMP value defines the number of lowest structural modes used in final output preparation prior to any filtering. The default is ALL. If STRUCTMP $\mathbf{\bar{\rho}}=\mathbf{\rho}$ NONE, no structural MPF is generated.   
9. The FLUID option selects MPF calculations for acoustic grid points (one degree of freedom per point).The STRUCTMP value defines the number of lowest structural modes used in final output preparation of acoustic structure MPFs prior to any filtering. The default is NONE. The FLUIDMP value defines the number of lowest fluid modes used in final output preparation of acoustic fluid MPFs prior to any filtering. The default is NONE.   
10.The SOLUTION keyword can be used to select a subset of solutions available.If setfis specified, the items in the set are excitation frequencies.   
11. The filter is applied to the real part of the normalized projected participation factors. Only participation factors that pass the filter are output.   
12. If the magnitude of the total response at a selected response degree offreedom is less than $10^{-i p o w r}$ thennoMPFepcesedIfwerstinhengeofIto,thefaultofisused.   
13.Acoustic panel MPFs are normalized using the panel response instead of the total response.   
14.If present, output of acoustic structural MPFs includes the load participation factor. The load participation factor has a mode number of O and a resonance frequency of 0.   
15.Output sets that define no valid model degrees of freedom for data recovery produce no PF output. This condition is usually discovered prior to actual computations and an informational message is generated. Occasionally, when multiple subcases are involved and one of the subcases references an invalid set, the PF calculations are still performed for any valid combinations.PRTMSG can be used to aid in identification of invalid set data under these conditions.

Remarks:  

1. All PFMODE(FLUID), PFPANEL, and PFGRID Case Control commands must reference the same set of fluid degrees of freedom.   
2. Acoustic panel participation factors are available in a coupled frequency response analysis (SOL 108 and SOL 111).   
3. Printed output includes results for all the data items described in the itemlist table.   
4. Punched output includes results for only the data items selected by the ITEMS keyword.   
5. Panel participation factors are alphabetically sorted by panel names unless the SORT keyword specifies adiferent sorting order.Ifa sorting order is specified, the KEY keyword selects the item that is used for sorting. When MODEDISP is selected, sorting is based on the magnitude. When MODERESP is selected, sorting is based on the real part.   
6.The SOLUTION keyword can be used to select a subset of solutions available.If set setf is specified, the items in the set are excitation frequencies. 7. The filter is applied to the real part of the normalized projected participation factors. Only participation factors that pass the filter are output.   
8. If the magnitude of the total response at a selected response degree of freedom is less than $10^{-\mathrm{ipowr}}$ thennomodalparticipationfactorsareprocessed.Ifpowerisnotintherangeoflto, the default of 12 is used. 9.If present, output includes the load participation factor. The panel name of the load participation factors is --LOAD-.   
10. The FLUID option selects panel PF calculation for acoustic grid points (one degree of freedom per point) and setdof should be identification numbers.   
11. The STRUCTURE option selects panel PF calculation for structure grid points and setdof should be identification numbers and component codes.   
12.Output sets that define no valid model degrees of freedom for data recovery produce no PF output. This condition is usually discovered prior to actual computations and an informational is generated. Occasionally,when multiple subcases are involved and one of the subcases references an invalid set, the PF calculations are stillperformed for any valid combinations. PRTMSG can be used to aid in identification of invalid set data under these conditions.  

Defines a character string that will appear on the first frame of any plotter output.  

Format: PLOTID $\c=$ title  

PLOTID $\c=$ BLDG.125 BOX 91  

Example:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>title</td><td>Any character string.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. PLOTID must appear before the OUTPUT(PLOT) or OUTPUT(XYOUT) Case Control commands.  

2.The presence of PLOTID causes a special header frame to be plotted, with the supplied identificatior plotted several times. The header frame allows plotter output to be identified easily.  

3. If no PLOTID command appears, no ID frame will be plotted.  

4. The PLOTID header frame will not be generated for the table plotters.  

Controlsselection of data to be output for postprocessing functions via the OUTPUT2 module interface for selected commercial postprocessor products.  

Format:  

POST PATRAN TOFILE 51 NOSTRESS POST TOFILE SUBCASE8 POST TOCASE SUFNAME1  

Examples:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>TOFILE</td><td>Keyword to specify the destiny of .op2 output files (No default if it appears above all subcases).</td></tr><tr><td>TOCASE</td><td>Keyword to specify the destiny of subcase results to user-defined .fO6 output files. (No default if it appears above all subcases.)</td></tr><tr><td>furn</td><td>Fortran file unit reference number where data will be written (Integer > 0).</td></tr><tr><td>filename</td><td>Suffix filename (see Remark 8.,9. and 11.) (Char8)</td></tr><tr><td> ppname</td><td>Name of the target post-processor program for TOFILE option (Default = PATRAN).</td></tr><tr><td>oplist</td><td>Names of output items to be processed.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The POST Case Control command controls the placement of output data on external FORTRAN files for use by commercial postprocessors. Use of the POST command generates the proper value for the POST DMAP parameter associated with the particular postprocessor. Allof the other parameter controls related to the POST DMAP parameter remain in effect, and are described in Parameters, 783. The products supported are identified in the following table. PATRAN is the default postprocessor name used for ppname. DBC output $(\mathrm{POST}{=}0)_{,}$ ) cannot be controlled by the POST command.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>ppname</td><td>Product</td><td>PARAM,POST,Value</td></tr><tr><td>PATRAN</td><td>MSC Patran V3</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>SDRC</td><td>SDRCI-DEAS</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>NF</td><td>MSC/LMS NF</td><td>-4 </td></tr><tr><td>FEMTOOLS</td><td>DDS/FemTools</td><td>-5 </td></tr><tr><td>UNIGRAHICS</td><td>EDS/Unigraphics</td><td>-6</td></tr></table></body></html>  

2. The TOFILE describer is follwed by the specification ofeither a FORTRAN unit reference number, or a file name associated with the external file that receives the output data. If a FORTRAN unit number is used, the file must be associated with it via the ASSIGN File Management Statement. If POST appears above allsubcases, TOFILE must be used to specify either a FORTRAN unit reference number or a file name. The default value of TOFILE, which appears under a subcase, will inherit from the value given in the POST above all subcases. If the unit reference number is associated with a form $\c=$ formatted file, changes in unit numbers across subcases are not allowed.  

3.The data that can be controlled for each postprocessor product is limited, and is identified under the description of the POST and related DMAP parameters as described in Parameters,783. The keywords that can be used for the oplist options are shown in the following table.If an output item supported by a particular postprocessor is described in Parameters, 783 but is not listed here, then the POST command cannot be used to control its output to the external file.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Output Item</td><td>oplist Keyword</td><td>Case Command</td></tr><tr><td>Displacements</td><td>[NO]DISPLACE</td><td>DISP</td></tr><tr><td>Forces of single point constraint</td><td>[NO]SPCFORCE</td><td>SPCFORCE</td></tr><tr><td>Element forces</td><td>[NO]FORCES</td><td>ELFO/FORCE</td></tr><tr><td>Element stresses</td><td>[NO]STRESS</td><td>ELST/STRESS</td></tr><tr><td>Element strain energy</td><td>[NO]ESE</td><td>ESE</td></tr><tr><td>Grid point force balance</td><td>[NO]GPFORCE</td><td>GPFORCE</td></tr><tr><td>Stress at grid points</td><td>[NO]GPSIGMA</td><td>STRESS</td></tr><tr><td> Strain/curvature at grid points</td><td>[NO]GPEPSILON</td><td>STRAIN</td></tr><tr><td>Composite element failure indices</td><td>[NO]PLYFAILURE</td><td>STRESS</td></tr><tr><td>Element kinetic energy</td><td>[NO]EKE</td><td>EKE</td></tr><tr><td>Element energy loss</td><td>[NO]EDE</td><td>EDE</td></tr><tr><td> Multi-point constraint forces</td><td>[NO]MPCFORCE</td><td>MPCFORCE</td></tr><tr><td>Composite lamina stresses</td><td>[NO]PLYSIGMA</td><td>STRESS</td></tr><tr><td>Composite lamina strains</td><td>[NO]PLYEPSILON</td><td>STRAIN</td></tr><tr><td>Element strains</td><td>[NO]STRAIN</td><td>STRAIN</td></tr><tr><td>Grid point stresses</td><td>[NO]GPSTRESS</td><td>GPSTRESS</td></tr><tr><td>Grid point strains</td><td>[NO]GPSTRAIN</td><td>GPSTRAIN</td></tr><tr><td>Applied loads</td><td>[NO]LOAD</td><td>OLOAD</td></tr><tr><td>No items to be output</td><td>NONE</td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Structure mode participation factors</td><td>[NO]SMPF</td><td>PFMODE</td></tr></table></body></html>  

4.Output data items must have been generated via the appropriate Case Control command for the data to be available for postprocessing options.For example, the specification of SPCF in the oplist of the POST command willnot produce forces of single point constraint on the POST output file unless there is a SPCF Case Control command present. Refer to the tables under the POST parameter description in Parameters, 783 for a list of the output items supported by each postprocessor.   
5. Any data generated bya Case Control command is automatically included in the oplist of the POST command. If output data is not wanted for a particular case, then the characters“NO" should be the first two characters of the keyword in the oplist. For example, NODISP specifies that displacements are not to be posted to the output file, even though they have been requested via the DISP Case Control command. Alternatively, the related POST parameters may be used. For example, to avoid outputting any displacements whatsoever to the .op2 file, use a PARAM, OUG, NO Bulk Data entry.   
6. Certain data (e.g., geometry) is always generated and is not dependent upon the presence ofa Case Control command in the input data. The POST command affects the placement of this data on the external file only insofar as the selection of the postprocessr defines the value of the POST DMAP parameter value. The actions described in Parameters,783 under the POST parameter description wil prevail for the particular value of POST associated with the selected postprocessor. The primary purpose of the POST command is to give the user more control over subcase-dependent output data being stored on the external OUTPUT2 file.   
7. If a POST command is present within any subcase, a POST command must also be present above the subcase level. The placement of the POST command above the subcase level causes a cumulative effect on POST commands in subsequent subcases.Any options specified above the subcase level propagate down into the POST command within a subsequent subcase. Thus, if a POST command specifies NODISP (no displacement output wanted) above the subcase level, then a POST command with the DISP option would be required within a subcase to generate any output to the OUTPUT2 file for displacements.This also implies that changing the OUTPUT2 file unit reference number with the TOFILE option in a subcase causes all output quantities currently scheduled for output to be switched to the new unit number, not just those in the oplist for the current POST command.   
8.When the name ofan output file is specified by keyword TOFILE,the ASSIGN statement in the File Management Section (FMS) can be used to specify the fullpath of its root name.The logical-keyword for the root name is OUTPUT2F.The default root name is the Nastran job name. FORTRAN unit reference number 19 has been reserved by Nastran for OUTPUT2F, although the user can assign other FORTRAN unit number to it. The full file name is in the form of <root name>.<suffix filename>.   
9.When the name of an output file is specified by keyword TOCASE, the ASSIGN statement in the File Management Section can be used to specify the full path of its root name. The logical-keyword for the root name is OPCASE. The default root name is the Nastran job name. FORTRAN unit reference number 22 has been reserved by Nastran for OPCASE, although the user can assign other FORTRAN unit numbers to it. The fullfile name is in the form of <root name>.<suffx filename>. Also, ppname and oplist are not required. If ppname and oplist are specified, they will be ignored. Suffix filename must be specified with keyword TOCASE.   
10. POST commands using TOCASE for structure mode participation factor output (SMPF) are not  

supported and will be ignored.  

11. The TOFILE option lets you control the output results (per the table in Remark 3) that are placed on the specified file in OP2 format. The "POST TOFILE SUBASE8" example directs output to the file named <root name>.subcase8.op2. The TOCASE option directs standard printed output requested for a subcase to the specified file in .f06 format. The "POST TOCASE SUFNAM1" example directs output to the file named <root name>.sufnaml.f06. The TOCASE and TOFILE describers are independent of one another. POST commands using each describer may be present in a subcase to specify diffrent output destinations for both .op2 and .fO6 outputs at the same time. For both the TOCASE and TOFILE options, the resulting file name will not have the .op2 or the .f06 file extension automatically appended if the file suffix name contains a period (".").  

12. The TOCASE keyword is not supported for printout in the f06 file coming from X-Y Plot commands.  

Requests form and type of pressure output. Analogous to the DISPLACEMENT Case Control command.   
See the description of the DISPLACEMENT Case Control command, DISPLACEMENT (Case), 298.  

Selects the RANDPS and RANDT1 Bulk Data entries to be used in random analysis.  

Format:

$$  

Examples: RANDOM $[=177$  

SET $\scriptstyle10=100$ 110 120 RANDOM $\mathtt{\Omega}=10$  

<html><body><table><tr><td> Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification number of a previously appearing SET command, which in turn references multiple RANDPS/RANDT1 Bulk Data entries with different set identification numbers.</td></tr><tr><td>i</td><td>Set identification number of RANDPS and RANDT1 Bulk Data entries to be used in random analysis (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. RANDOM must select RANDPS Bulk Data entries to perform random analysis.   
2. RANDOM must appear in the first subcase of the current loop. RANDPS Bulk Data entries may not reference subcases in a diffrent loop. Loops are defined by a change in the FREQUENCY command, or changes in the K2PP, M2PP, or B2PP commands.   
3. If RANDPS entries are used in a superelement analysis, the RANDOM command may be specified above the subcase level if a condensed subcase structure (SUPER $\approx$ ALL) is used. If a condensed subcase structure is not used, then a unique RANDOM selection of a unique RANDPS entry must be specified within each of the desired superelement subcases.   
4. P-elements are not supported in random analysis   
5.Ifa SET is referenced by n, then the SET identification number must be unique with respect to all RANDPS/RANDT1 set identification numbers.

Remarks:  

1. Case Control command RCROSS must be used along with Case Control command RANDOM. See Remarks under the RANDoM (Case), 547 Case Control command description.  

2. Response quantities such as DISPLACEMENT, STRESS, and FORCE must be requested by corresponding Case Control commands in order to compute cross-power spectral density and crosscorrelation functions between the two response quantities specified by the RCROSS Bulk Data entry. It is recommended that those requests be put above the subcase level to avoid the situation that some response quantities are missing when it comes to the random analysis postprocessing.   
3.The response quantities must belong to the same superelement. The cros-power spectral density and cross-correlation functions between the two responses, which belong to the different superelements, are not supported.  

Delimits and identifies a repeated output subcase.  

Format: REPCASE $\scriptstyle\cdot=\mathbf{n}$  

Example: REPCASE=137   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Subcase identification number. (Integer > 1)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. n must be strictly increasing (i.e., must be greater than all previous subcase identification numbers).   
2. REPCASE defines a subcase that is used to make additional output requests for the previous real subcase. This command is required because multiple output requests for the same item are not permitted in the same subcase.   
3. One or more repeated subcases (REPCASEs) must immediately follow the subcase (SUBCASE) to which they refer.   
4. REPCASE may be used only in statics and normal modes analysis. In normal modes analysis, output for only one mode is obtained. This output corresponds to the SUBCASE preceding the REPCASE.   
5.If the referenced subcases contain thermal loads or element deformations, the user must define the temperature field in the REPCASE with a TEMP(LOAD) Case Control command, or the element deformation state with a DEFORM command.  

6. Repcase is not applicable to SOLs 400, 600, and 700.

Remarks:  

1．RESVEC $\stackrel{\cdot}{}=$ SYSTEM/NOSYSTEM and RESVEC $\v{x}_{\cdot}=$ COMPONENT/NOCOMPONENT may be specified in the same subcase.   
2.RESVEC $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ BOTH is the default in all solution sequences except SOLs 103, 106, (with PARAM,NMLOOP), and 115,wherein RESVEC $\dot{\mathbf{\Omega}}=\mathbf{\Omega}$ COMPONENT is the default.   
3. If the RESVEC command is specified then the user parameters PARAM,RESVEC and PARAM,RESVINER are ignored.   
4. The lower frequency cutoff on the EIGR or EIGRL Bulk Data entries should be left blank or set to a value below the minimum frequency. Residual vectors may not be calculated if all modes below the maximum frequency cutoffare not determined. Iflow frequency modes are to be excluded from the analysis, use the MODESELECT Case Control command or PARAM,LFREQ.   
5. Caution needs to be exercised when allowing the residual vectors to respond dynamicaly in a modal solution.The best approach is to always include enough normal modes to capture the dynamics of the problem,and rely on the residual vectors to help account for the influence ofthe truncated modes on the quasistatic portion of the response.This is not the default setting for this capability. When choosing to allow the residual vectors to respond dynamicaly, it is important to be aware of the frequency content of the excitation, as it willhave the ability to excite these augmentation modes. If this is undesirable, then the forcing function should be filtered in advance to remove any undesired frequency content, or specify the NODYNRSP keyword.   
6. Residual vectors are normalized with respect to MASS if possible. Massless residual vectors are normalized with respect to STIFFNESS. Residual vectors are not normalized by the requested method of the NORM field of the selected EIGR or EIGRL entry.   
7. The maximum number ofapplied loads that may be used for residual vector calculations is controlled by PARAM,MAXAPL. Note that if the number of applied loads is large, the cost can become prohibitive. If the number of applies loads exceeds MAXAPL, residual vectors are disabled.  

The RGYRO Case Control command activates the rotodynamics capability, and selects the RGYRO Bulk Data entry for use in complex modes,frequency response, and static analysis.For transient response, the RGYRO command selects the UNBALNC Bulk Data entry.If the UNBALNC entry is not required, setting RGYRO to YES will include the gyroscopic effects in the transient response calculation. Setting RGYRO to NO will deactivate gyroscopic effects in all solutions.  

Format: For complex modes, frequency response, and static analysis:  

${\mathrm{RGYRO}}={\mathrm{n}}$ or YES/NO  

Examples: RGYRO = 100  

For Transient Response: RGYR( $\mathrm{~\boldsymbol~{~\gamma~}~})\ =\ \mathrm{~\boldsymbol~{~Y~}~}$ ES or $\mathsf{R G Y R O}~=~200$

Example: RIGID $\c=$ LAGRAN   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>LINEAR</td><td>Selects the linear elimination method.</td></tr><tr><td>LAGRAN</td><td>Selects the Lagrange multiplier method.</td></tr><tr><td>LGELIM</td><td>Selects the Lagrange multiplier method with elimination.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The RIGID command must be above the SUBCASE level.   
2. The RIGID command can be used in SOLs 101, 103, 105, and 400 only. For all other solution sequences, only RIGID $\mid=$ LINEAR is available.   
3. If the RIGID command is not specified in the Case Control Section, RIGID $\mid=$ LINEAR is used for all solution sequences except SOL 400. For SOL 400, RIGID $\mid=$ LAGRAN is used. If the RIGID command is specified, the full command must be specified, including the right hand side.   
4.RIGID $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ LGELIM is not available for SOL 400.   
5. LINEAR processing willnot compute thermal loads. Also, for SOLs 103 and 105, LINEAR processing will not compute differential stiffness. In order to compute thermal load or differential stiffness, the LAGRAN or LGELIM methods must be used.   
6. For SOL 400, the LINEAR rigid elements are valid for small rotation only. The LAGRAN method is valid for both small and large rotation (parameter LGDISP $^{\circ}=1$ ）   
7. For the LINEAR method, the dependent DOFs are eliminated and placed in the mp-set. For the LAGRAN method, both independent and dependent DOFs are placed in the l-set. Lagrange multiplier DOFs are created internally for the dependent DOFs and placed in l-set. For the LGELIM method, the LAGRAN rigid elements are created first. Then, both the Lagrange DOFs and the dependent DOFs are eliminated, and the dependent DOFs are placed in the mr-set. Both the mp-set and mr-set are subsets of the m-set. See Degree-of-Freedom Set Definitions, 1112.   
8. Between LAGRAN and LGELIM, LAGRAN is the preferred method. LGELIM is a backup method if difficulty is encountered using the LAGRAN method.   
9. The parameters LMFACT and PENFN can be used as scale factor and penalty function, respectively, for the LAGRAN method of processing.   
10. In a SOL 400 analysis with CWELD, CFAST, and/or CSEAM elements Nastran internally creates RBE3 elements. These internal RBE3 elements respond in the same way to the RIGID command as any other rigid body elements that may have been defined in the model. Therefore the RIGID command also has an effect on the behavior of CWELD and CFAST elements in a SOL 400 analysis. For "ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLSTAT" or "ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLTRAN", the generated RBE3 constraints become Lagrange elements and will undergo large rotation. For "ANALYSIS $\dot{\mathbf{\eta}}=\mathbf{\eta}$ NLTRAN" with initial conditions $(\mathrm{IC=n})_{\cdot}$ ) in case control that cause large initial stresses in the structure at time $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{{t=0}}}$ ,the case control entry RIGID needs to have the value "RIGID $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ LINEAR." If "PARAM, OLDWELD, YES" is specified, the CSEAM is considered a linear element.   
11. For external superelements, both the Case Control Command EXTSEOUT and the PARAM, EXTOUT, REQUIRE a value of RIGID $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ LINEAR (the default for non SOL400 solution sequences) when running non SOL 400 jobs.   
.2. When creating superelements in SOL 400, RIGID $\c=$ LAGRAN produces incorrect answers, RIGIDLINEAR should be used or put the rigid elements into the residual.   
3. When RIGID $\vDash$ LAGRAN is used, one may observe SWM 4968, indicating negative terms on multiple DOF which is due to the Lagrange multiplier. This messge may be ignored and an accurate solution will be obtained.   
14.When RIGID $\vDash$ LAGRAN is used, the CASI iterative solver may fail to converge or terminate, one should switch to a direct solver.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>STRUCTURE or FLUID</td><td>Modal damping is requested for the structural or fluid portion of the model.</td></tr><tr><td>COUPLED</td><td>Modal damping is requested for the structure and fluid coupled portion of the model.</td></tr><tr><td>ｎ</td><td>Set identification number of a TABDMPl or TABLEDi Bulk Data entry (Integer>0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. In the modal solutions (e.g.,SOLs 110,111, 112, 145, 146, and 200), SDAMPING must reference a TABDMP1 entry.   
2.In direct frequency response analysis (e.g.,SOL 108),SDAMPING must reference a TABLEDi entry which defines viscoelastic (frequency-dependent) material properties. See Viscoelastic Materials in Frequency Response Analysis in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
3. When SDAMPING is defined for a superelement, PARAM,SESDAMP must be placed either in the SUBCASE for the superelement or in the superelement's BEGIN SUPER section in order to activate the modal damping for the superelement. The default for superelements is to place all boundary points in the B set; in this case, PARAM,SESDAMP,AUG is recommended. Alternatively, place all boundary points in the C set and set PARAM,SESDAMP,YES.   
4. When SDAMPING is used during FRF component generation, PARAM,KDAMP,-1 is recommended in order to place the modal damping terms in the imaginary part of the stiffness matrix. The default for KDAMP is 0, which places the modal damping terms in the damping matrix, leading to a marginally under or over damped response. When hybrid damping is used during FRF component generation, it is recommended to set the KDAMP field to YES on the HYBDAMP entry.  

5. When SDAMPING is used with METHOD(COUPLED), SDAMPING(COUPLED) should be used. For the real coupled mode computation, structural modes and fluid modes are not separated. So SDAMPING(STRUCTURE) or SDAMPING(FLUID) cannot be used properly. When SDAMPING(STRUCTURE/FLUID) is used with METHOD(COUPLED), it returns fatal out.  

Requests the form and type of solution set displacement output  

Format:  

SDISPLACEMENT $\backslash=.$ ALL SDISPLACEMENT(SORT2,PUNCH,PHASE) $\c=$ NONE  

Examples:   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Describer</td><td>Meaning</td></tr><tr><td>SORT1</td><td>Output will be presented as a tabular listing of grid points for each load, frequency, eigenvalue, or time, depending on the solution sequence.</td></tr><tr><td>SORT2</td><td>Output will be presented as a tabular listing of frequency or time for each grid point (or mode number).</td></tr><tr><td>PRINT</td><td>The printer will be the output medium.</td></tr><tr><td>PUNCH</td><td>The punch file will be the output medium.</td></tr><tr><td>REAL or IMAG</td><td>Requests rectangular format (real and imaginary) of complex output. Use of either REAL or IMAG yields the same output.</td></tr><tr><td>PHASE</td><td>Requests polar format (magnitude and phase) of complex output. Phase output is in degrees.</td></tr><tr><td>ALL</td><td>Displacements for all solution set points (modes) will be output.</td></tr><tr><td>NONE</td><td>Displacements for no solution set points (modes) willbe output.</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>Set identification number of a previously appearing SET command. Only displacements on points with identification numbers that appear on this SET command will be output (Integer > 0).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Remarks:  

1. The defaults for SORT1 and SORT2 depend on the type of analysis,and is discussed in Remark 1 under the DISPLACEMENT (Case), 298 Case Control command. If SORT1 is selected for any of the commands SACC, SDIS, and SVEL then the remaining commands will also be SORT1.   
2. SDISPLACEMENT $\dot{}=\mathbf{\nabla}$ NONE allows an overall output request to be overridden.   
3. The SDISPLACEMENT command is required to output normalized complex eigenvectors.  

Specifies the superelement identification numbers of Phase 1 processing in which all matrices and loads are generated and assembled. Controls execution of the solution sequence.

Remarks:  

1. This command, if present, must be located before the first SUBCASE command.   
2. Zero (O) is the identification number ofthe residual structure, and can only appear as a member of a SET.   
3.For a further discussion of this command, see Superelement Analysis in the MSC Nastran Reference Guide.   
4. Ifi is used, the superelement identification number must be unique with respect to any SET identification numbers used.   
5. This command combines, in one command, the functions of the SEMG, SELG, SEKR, SELR, and SEMR commands.   
6. This command does not control superelement data recovery (Phase 3). See the SEDR (Case), 563 Case Control command description.   
7. SEALL $\therefore$ ALL is the default but can be overridden by specifying any of the following Phase 1 commands: SEALL, SEMG, SELG, SEKR, SELR, or SEMR.
